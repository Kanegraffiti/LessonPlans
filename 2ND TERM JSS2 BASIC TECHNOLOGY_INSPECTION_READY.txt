Lesson Content:
Circle
- A circle is a plane figure bounded by a curved line called circumference.

Parts of a Circle
- Centre: fixed point equidistant from all points on circumference.
- Radius: line from centre to circumference.
- Diameter: line through centre touching circumference at both ends.
- Chord: line joining any two points on circumference.
- Sector: region bounded by two radii and an arc.
- Segment: region bounded by a chord and an arc.
- Quadrant: one-quarter of a circle.
- Tangent: straight line touching the circle at one point.

Drawing a Circle
- Mark centre point.
- Set compass to required radius.
- Rotate compass fully to form the circle.
Evaluation:
1. Define a circle.
2. Differentiate radius and diameter.
3. What is a chord?
4. Define sector and segment.
5. Draw and label a circle showing six parts.
6. Why must compass setting remain fixed while drawing a circle?
Conclusion:
- Teacher concludes that accurate understanding of circle parts is necessary for technical constructions.
Assignment:
1. Write and explain the parts of a circle.
2. Draw and label a circle showing centre, radius, diameter, chord, sector, and tangent.
3. Explain two differences between sector and segment.

- Teacher presents a practical challenge: finding centre of a drawn circle.
Step 2: Presentation/Teaching Steps
- Teacher demonstrates construction through three non-collinear points.
- Teacher demonstrates method of finding centre using perpendicular bisectors of two chords.
- Teacher demonstrates simple touching circles on converging lines.
- Teacher emphasizes drawing accuracy and neatness.
Step 3: Learners’ Activities
- Learners carry out guided constructions individually.
- Learners compare results in groups and correct errors.
- Learners label all construction lines neatly.
Step 4: Summary/Board Summary
- Construction through three points.
- Method of locating circle centre.
- Steps for touching circles.
Lesson Content:
Construction Through Three Points
- Join points with straight lines.
- Draw perpendicular bisectors of two sides.
- Intersection of bisectors gives centre.
- Use centre and radius to draw circle through the three points.

Finding Centre of a Given Circle
- Draw two chords in the circle.
- Construct perpendicular bisector of each chord.
- Intersection point is the centre.

Touching Circles on Converging Lines
- Draw converging lines.
- Bisect included angle to locate possible centres.
- Construct larger circle, then smaller touching circle using geometric steps.
Evaluation:
