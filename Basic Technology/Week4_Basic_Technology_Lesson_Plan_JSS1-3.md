DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 8th October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Rescue Operations
- **Subtopic:** Securing the Environment, Vehicles, and Victims; Steps Involved in Each Aspect of a Rescue Operation
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Technology for JSS 2; Emergency Response Training Manual; Nigerian Red Cross First Aid Guide
- **Instructional Materials:** Rescue operation flowchart, safety cones, dummy victim, first-aid kit, scenario cards, video clip of rescue scene
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have previously discussed the meaning of rescue operations and basic first-aid principles.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Outline steps for securing an accident environment before rescue.
  2. Describe procedures for stabilising vehicles involved in an accident.
  3. State safety precautions when approaching and assessing victims.
  4. Organise rescue steps in the correct order using a flowchart.
  5. Role-play a rescue scenario demonstrating teamwork and safety practices.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows a short video of an accident scene and asks students to note the first actions rescuers took.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher explains that rescue operations involve three main areas: securing the environment, securing vehicles, and caring for victims.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher details steps for each area: (a) environment—assess hazards, control traffic, set up warning signs; (b) vehicles—switch off engines, apply wheel chocks, stabilise vehicles; (c) victims—check responsiveness, call emergency services, provide basic first aid.

**Step 4 – Application:** Groups use scenario cards to plan and role-play rescue operations, ensuring they follow the correct sequence of steps.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher reviews group performances, asking questions about safety precautions and step order.

### Content Summary

1. Securing the **environment** involves assessing dangers, using warning signs, and keeping bystanders safe.
2. Securing **vehicles** includes switching off engines, applying brakes, and stabilising vehicles to prevent further movement.
3. Securing **victims** requires checking breathing and consciousness, calling for help, and giving first aid without causing more harm.
4. Rescue steps must follow an orderly sequence to ensure **rescuer safety** and **victim survival**.

### Conclusion

Teacher reiterates that organised rescue operations protect rescuers, victims, and other road users.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Rescue operations begin with **scene safety** before touching victims.
- Use **warning devices** and control traffic to protect the area.
- Stabilise vehicles to stop further accidents.
- Assess victims gently, call for medical help, and provide basic first aid.

### Assignment

Create a flowchart showing the steps to take when you arrive first at a road accident scene. Indicate at least two actions under each heading: environment, vehicles, victims.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Thursday, 9th October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 3
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Third
- **Topic:** Processing of Materials – Metals
- **Subtopic:** Metal Processing Methods with Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Technology for JSS 3; Metalwork Technology Textbook; Manufacturing Processes Handbook
- **Instructional Materials:** Samples or images of metal products, process diagrams (casting, forging, rolling, welding, machining), comparison chart, short documentary on metal production
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have identified common metal products and basic material properties in earlier lessons.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. List major methods of processing metals.
  2. Describe the basic steps involved in casting, forging, rolling, welding, and machining.
  3. Compare advantages and disadvantages of each method.
  4. Suggest appropriate processing methods for selected metal products.
  5. Analyse how safety measures differ across metal processing techniques.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays metal products (engine parts, spoons, beams) and asks students how each might have been made.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher introduces metal processing methods: casting, forging, rolling, welding, and machining.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains each method, highlighting processes, equipment, advantages (e.g., strength, precision, cost) and disadvantages (e.g., defects, energy use, skill requirements).

**Step 4 – Application:** Groups complete a comparison chart linking products to suitable processing methods, and note advantages/disadvantages for each choice.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher conducts a quick quiz where students match products with methods and justify their selections.

### Content Summary

1. **Casting** pours molten metal into moulds—advantage: complex shapes; disadvantage: possible porosity.
2. **Forging** shapes metal by hammering or pressing—advantage: strong products; disadvantage: requires high energy and skilled labour.
3. **Rolling** compresses metal between rollers—advantage: smooth, uniform thickness; disadvantage: high equipment cost.
4. **Welding** joins metals by melting edges—advantage: permanent joints; disadvantage: risk of weak seams and requires protective gear.
5. **Machining** cuts metal to size—advantage: high precision; disadvantage: material waste and tool wear.

### Conclusion

Teacher notes that understanding processing methods helps students choose the best technique for different metal products.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Metals can be processed by **casting, forging, rolling, welding, and machining**.
- Each method has **strengths** and **limitations** affecting cost, quality, and safety.
- Choosing the right method depends on the **product shape**, **strength needed**, and **production volume**.
- Safety gear like **gloves, goggles, and aprons** is essential in metal workshops.

### Assignment

Choose any metal household item. Identify the processing method likely used to make it and write two advantages and two disadvantages of that method.
