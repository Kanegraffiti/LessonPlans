DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 1st October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Rescue Operations
- **Subtopic:** Securing the Environment, Vehicles, and Victims
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Technology for JSS 2; Red Cross First Aid Manual; Emergency Response Field Guide
- **Instructional Materials:** Rescue operation flowchart, hazard warning signs, first aid box, role-play props (cones, ropes, blankets)
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have knowledge of emergency numbers and basic first aid from previous lessons.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Outline steps for securing an accident environment before a rescue.
  2. Describe procedures for securing vehicles involved in an accident.
  3. Explain how to stabilise and protect victims during rescue operations.
  4. Demonstrate coordination of tasks among team members in a rescue scenario.
  5. Evaluate the importance of safety for rescuers and victims during operations.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher narrates a road accident scenario and asks students what should be done first before rescuers assist victims.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher introduces the three areas of rescue security: the environment, the vehicle, and the victim.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher details steps such as placing warning signs, switching off vehicle engines, applying hand brakes, checking for fuel leaks, approaching victims carefully, providing first aid, and calling emergency services.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students perform a role-play rescue drill, assigning tasks for securing the scene, stabilising vehicles, and caring for victims, while the teacher provides feedback.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on the order of actions and the reasons for each step.

### Content Summary

1. **Securing the environment** involves **assessing dangers**, **placing warning signs**, **diverting traffic**, and **wearing protective gear**.
2. **Securing vehicles** means **switching off engines**, **pulling hand brakes**, **checking for leaks**, and **stabilising with wedges or blocks**.
3. **Securing victims** includes **quick assessment**, **basic first aid**, **keeping victims warm**, and **waiting for professionals**.
4. Teamwork and communication keep rescuers safe and make operations efficient.

### Conclusion

Teacher reminds students that orderliness and safety precautions reduce further injuries during rescues.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Always **secure the scene** by warning other road users and removing hazards.
- Turn off the vehicle, apply brakes, and look for **fuel leaks** before touching victims.
- Give **basic first aid**, keep victims calm, and wait for trained professionals.
- Teamwork and protective equipment protect both rescuers and victims.

### Assignment

Describe the steps you would take to secure the environment, vehicle, and victims if a minibus has an accident near your school.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Thursday, 2nd October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 3
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Third
- **Topic:** Processing of Materials (Metals)
- **Subtopic:** Metal Processing Methods and Their Advantages and Disadvantages
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Technology for JSS 3; Workshop Technology Textbook; Metalworking Processes Manual
- **Instructional Materials:** Charts showing metal processing methods, samples of cast and forged objects, videos of metal workshops, comparative analysis worksheets
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have seen metal objects such as cooking pots, car parts, and tools.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Identify major metal processing methods used in industries.
  2. Describe steps involved in casting, forging, machining, and welding.
  3. Analyse advantages and disadvantages of each processing method.
  4. Match common products to appropriate metal processing techniques.
  5. Suggest safety precautions required during metal processing activities.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows samples of cast pots and forged spanners and asks students how the objects were formed.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher introduces the main metal processing methods: casting, forging, machining, rolling, and welding.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains each method, highlighting processes, equipment, advantages, and disadvantages (e.g., casting produces complex shapes but may have porosity).

**Step 4 – Application:** Students complete a worksheet matching products to processing methods and list pros and cons; groups present their findings.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to mention processing methods, describe steps, and discuss pros and cons.

### Content Summary

1. Metal processing methods include **casting**, **forging**, **machining**, **rolling**, and **welding**.
2. **Casting** forms complex shapes but may have **shrinkage defects**; **forging** improves strength but needs **skilled labour**; **machining** gives precise finish but produces **waste**; **rolling** makes uniform sheets but requires **expensive mills**; **welding** joins metals but joints may **weaken under stress** if poorly done.
3. Safety precautions: **wear protective gear**, **handle hot metals carefully**, **use proper ventilation**, and **follow workshop rules**.
4. Choosing the right method depends on **product shape**, **strength requirements**, **cost**, and **production volume**.

### Conclusion

Teacher stresses that understanding metal processes helps students choose suitable methods for manufacturing tasks.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Metals can be processed by **casting, forging, machining, rolling, and welding**.
- Each method has strengths and weaknesses; for example, casting creates complex shapes while forging increases strength.
- Safety gear like **gloves, goggles, and aprons** protects workers from heat and sparks.
- Selecting a process depends on the **shape**, **strength**, and **quantity** of the product.

### Assignment

Create a table listing five metal products around you. State the likely processing method used for each and one advantage of the chosen method.
