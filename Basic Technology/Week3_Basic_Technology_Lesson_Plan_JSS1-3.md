1. A **pedestrian** is a person walking along a road or on footpaths.
2. Safety guidelines: **walk on sidewalks**, **face oncoming traffic if no sidewalk**, **look left-right-left before crossing**, **use zebra crossings or bridges**, **obey traffic signals**, and **wear bright or reflective clothing at night**.
3. Following safety rules prevents **accidents**, **injuries**, and **loss of life**.
4. Pedestrians should stay alert, avoid phone distractions, and walk in groups when possible.

### Conclusion

Teacher emphasises that careful pedestrians protect themselves and others from road accidents.

### Student Lesson Notes

- A **pedestrian** is anyone walking on the road or footpath.
- Safety rules include **using sidewalks**, **checking both sides before crossing**, **obeying traffic lights**, and **using pedestrian bridges**.
- At night, pedestrians must **wear reflective clothes** and **carry a torch** if possible.

### Assignment

Write five safety guidelines for pedestrians and explain why each guideline is important.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 1st October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Rescue Operations
- **Subtopic:** Meaning and Different Aspects of Rescue Operations
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Technology for JSS 2; First Aid and Safety Manuals; Red Cross Training Guides
- **Instructional Materials:** First aid box, rescue operation charts, role-play props (stretchers, whistles, ropes), video clips of rescue scenes
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have witnessed emergency drills or heard about rescue operations during disasters.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Define rescue operations.
  2. Mention types of emergencies that require rescue operations.
  3. Identify different aspects of rescue operations such as search, evacuation, and first aid.
  4. Describe the roles of rescue personnel and equipment.
  5. Demonstrate simple rescue responses through role-play activities.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher plays a short video of emergency responders helping victims and asks students what is happening.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines rescue operations as organised efforts to save people from danger or distress.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses aspects of rescue operations including search and location, extrication, first aid, transportation to safety, and coordination with emergency services.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students role-play a rescue scenario, assigning roles such as searchers, first aiders, and transporters, demonstrating how each aspect works together.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on the meaning of rescue operations and the different aspects involved.

### Content Summary

1. **Rescue operations** are organised activities to save people from dangerous situations like accidents, fires, floods, or building collapses.
2. Aspects include **searching for victims**, **extricating or freeing them**, **giving first aid**, **transporting to safety**, and **coordinating with emergency services**.
3. Rescue personnel include **firefighters**, **paramedics**, **police**, **Red Cross volunteers**, and trained community members.
4. Rescue equipment includes **stretchers**, **ropes**, **lifebuoys**, **ambulances**, and **communication devices**.

### Conclusion

Teacher reminds students that quick, coordinated rescue operations save lives and reduce the impact of disasters.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Rescue operations** mean organised actions to save people from danger.
