### Content Summary

1. A **pedestrian** is a person who travels on foot along roads and paths.
2. Key safety rules include **using sidewalks**, **looking left-right-left before crossing**, **obeying pedestrian signals**, **using bridges**, and **avoiding distractions** like phones or loud music.
3. Pedestrians should wear **bright or reflective clothing** at night and walk **facing oncoming traffic** where sidewalks are absent.
4. Following safety guidelines prevents **accidents**, **injuries**, and **loss of life**.

### Conclusion

Teacher reinforces that careful pedestrians protect themselves and other road users.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Pedestrians are **people who walk** on or near the road.
- Walk on the **sidewalk** or the **left side facing traffic** if there is no sidewalk.
- Use **zebra crossings**, **pedestrian bridges**, and **traffic lights** correctly.
- Stay **alert**, avoid distractions, and wear **reflective materials** at night.
- Practise the **stop, look, listen, think** routine every time you cross to build safe habits.
- Share safety tips with younger siblings or neighbours so everyone in your community walks more safely.

### Assignment

Write five pedestrian safety rules and explain how each rule prevents accidents.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 1st October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Rescue Operations
- **Subtopic:** Meaning of Rescue Operations and Different Aspects of Rescue Operations
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Technology for JSS 2; Red Cross First Aid Manual; National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) Field Guide
- **Instructional Materials:** Rescue operation flowchart, emergency response posters, first aid box, role-play props (cones, ropes, stretchers)
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students are familiar with emergency phone numbers and basic first aid procedures from previous lessons.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Define rescue operations.
  2. Identify different aspects or stages of rescue operations.
  3. Describe the roles of rescue team members in each aspect.
  4. Outline safety precautions for rescuers and victims during operations.
  5. Perform a simple role-play illustrating at least two aspects of rescue operations.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher narrates a scenario of a building collapse and asks students how rescuers save trapped victims.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines rescue operations as organised efforts to save people from danger or distress situations.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains aspects such as assessment of the scene, securing the environment, actual rescue (extrication), first aid and stabilisation, and evacuation or transportation of victims. Teacher also highlights communication and coordination among agencies.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students perform a role-play rescue drill, assigning teams to assess hazards, secure the area, remove victims safely, and provide basic first aid while communicating effectively.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on the meaning of rescue operations, stages involved, and safety measures to observe.

### Content Summary

1. **Rescue operations** are planned actions taken to save lives and prevent further harm during emergencies.
2. Key aspects include **scene assessment**, **environment security**, **victim extrication**, **first aid/stabilisation**, and **evacuation** to medical facilities.
3. Effective rescue work requires **teamwork**, **clear communication**, **use of protective equipment**, and **coordination** with emergency agencies.
4. Safety precautions protect both **rescuers** and **victims** from additional injury.

### Conclusion

Teacher stresses that well-organised rescue operations reduce casualties and speed up recovery.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Rescue operations are **organised efforts** to save people from danger.
- Stages include **assessing the scene**, **securing the area**, **rescuing victims**, **giving first aid**, and **evacuating to safety**.
- Team members must **communicate**, wear **protective gear**, and follow **safety rules**.
- Quick, coordinated action saves lives and prevents more harm.
- Learn local emergency numbers and practise saying **clear information** (who, what, where) when calling for help.
- Keep a simple list of **rescue roles**—such as leader, first aider, communicator—to understand how teams work together.

### Assignment

DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Thursday, 2nd October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 3
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Third
- **Topic:** Processing of Materials – Timber
- **Subtopic:** Importance of Timber, Treatment of Timber, and Importance of Proper Storage
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Technology for JSS 3; Woodwork Technology for Junior Secondary Schools; Forestry Commission Pamphlets
- **Instructional Materials:** Samples of seasoned and unseasoned wood, diagrams of timber storage racks, preservative cans, pictures showing timber defects
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can mention common wooden objects used at home and in school.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:

  2. Explain reasons for treating timber before use.
  3. Describe methods of timber treatment.
  4. Discuss the importance of proper timber storage.
  5. Differentiate between well-stored and poorly stored timber using given examples.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays timber samples and asks students to identify items around them made from wood.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher explains that timber is processed wood used for building, furniture, and other products, and needs proper treatment and storage to remain durable.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses importance (construction, furniture, flooring, tools), treatment methods (seasoning, chemical preservatives, painting, varnishing), and reasons for treatment (prevent decay, insect attack, warping). Teacher also highlights proper storage practices such as stacking on raised platforms, spacing for air circulation, and protecting from moisture and sunlight.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students examine timber samples to identify signs of good treatment and storage, then create a checklist for proper timber handling in the workshop.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to list uses of timber, describe treatment methods, and explain why proper storage matters.

### Content Summary

1. **Timber** is processed wood used for **buildings**, **furniture**, **flooring**, **doors**, and **tools**.
2. Timber is treated through **seasoning**, **chemical preservation**, **painting**, or **varnishing** to prevent **decay**, **insect attack**, and **warping**.
3. Proper storage involves **stacking on raised supports**, **providing air spaces**, **keeping timber dry**, and **shielding from direct sun or rain**.
4. Good treatment and storage extend the **life**, **strength**, and **appearance** of timber products.

### Conclusion

Teacher concludes that treated and well-stored timber remains strong, safe, and attractive for longer periods.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Timber** comes from trees and is used for **houses**, **furniture**, and **wooden tools**.
- We treat timber by **seasoning**, **painting**, or using **preservatives** to stop insects and rot.
- Store timber on **raised racks**, keep it **dry**, and allow **air to flow** between planks.
- Proper treatment and storage make timber **last long** and **look good**.
- Compare pictures of **good and bad storage** and note the differences to avoid costly mistakes in real projects.
- Record community examples of timber use, such as furniture makers or builders, and observe how they protect wood from moisture and pests.

### Assignment

Visit a carpenter’s workshop or timber shed in your area. Note three treatment methods and three storage practices used to keep timber in good condition.
