- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** First Aid
- **Subtopic:** Meaning of First Aid; Materials in a First Aid Box or Kit
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; STAN Basic Technology Textbook for JSS 2
- **Instructional Materials:** First aid box, bandages, plasters, antiseptic solution, cotton wool, triangular bandage
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have observed teachers or parents attend to minor injuries.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Define first aid correctly.
  2. Mention at least five materials found in a standard first aid box.
  3. State the uses of common first aid materials.
  4. Arrange materials in a first aid box properly during class demonstration.
  5. Explain why first aid is important before a victim is taken to the hospital.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher narrates a brief scenario of a pupil who sprained an ankle during sports and asks students what should be done immediately.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines first aid as the immediate and temporary care given to a sick or injured person before full medical treatment is available.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher shows the first aid box and explains the use of materials like bandages, plaster, scissors, antiseptic, cotton wool, safety pins, and gloves.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in pairs to arrange items correctly in a first aid box and discuss when each item should be used.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on the meaning of first aid, names of materials, and their uses to check understanding.

### Content Summary

1. First aid is the first help given to an injured or sick person before a doctor arrives.
2. Materials in a first aid box include adhesive plaster, bandages, antiseptic solution, cotton wool, scissors, safety pins, gloves, tweezers, thermometer, and triangular bandage.
3. Each material has a use: bandages cover wounds, antiseptic cleans injuries, cotton wool pads the wound, and gloves protect the first aider.

### Conclusion

Teacher reminds students that prompt first aid can save lives and encourages them to keep a simple first aid kit at home.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **First aid** is quick help given to a sick or injured person before taking them to the clinic or hospital.
- A **first aid box** keeps important materials such as **bandages**, **plasters**, **cotton wool**, **antiseptic**, **scissors**, **gloves**, **safety pins**, and **thermometer**.
- We use these materials to **clean wounds**, **cover and protect injuries**, **stop bleeding**, and **prevent infection** until a medical expert arrives.
- Everyone should stay calm, protect themselves with gloves, and call for help while giving first aid.

### Assignment

List ten items you would include in a school first aid box and write one use for each item.

### Content Summary

1. Timber defects include **knots**, **warping**, **twisting**, **shakes**, **splits**, **insect attack**, and **rot**.
2. Causes: natural growth, improper felling, poor storage, excess moisture, and insect activity.
3. Treatments: seasoning (air or kiln drying), chemical preservatives, fumigation, painting, polishing, and proper storage to keep timber dry.
4. Timber presentation involves selecting sound timber, seasoning it, treating against pests, and finishing with paint, stain, or varnish for protection and beauty.

### Conclusion

Teacher summarises timber defects, their causes, and treatments, stressing the importance of proper processing before timber is used.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Timber defects** are faults in wood that reduce its strength or appearance, such as **knots**, **warping**, **twisting**, **splits**, **shakes**, and **insect holes**.
- Defects come from **improper felling**, **poor drying**, **attack by insects or fungi**, and **bad storage conditions**.
- To treat timber, we **season** it to remove moisture, **apply preservatives** to stop insects and fungi, and **finish** the surface with **paint, varnish, or polish**.
- Proper **presentation of timber** means selecting good wood, drying it correctly, treating it, and finishing it so it is strong, durable, and attractive for construction or furniture.

### Assignment

Explain five timber defects and describe one treatment method for each defect.
