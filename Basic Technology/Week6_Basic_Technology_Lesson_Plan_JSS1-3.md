DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 22nd October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Materials and Their Common Uses
- **Subtopic:** Common Uses of Brass and Bronze
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Technology for JSS 2; Materials Science for Junior Secondary; Workshop Metalwork Guide
- **Instructional Materials:** Samples or pictures of brass and bronze objects (musical instruments, door handles, statues), comparison charts, conductivity tester, corrosion test images
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have previously studied metal properties and can differentiate between ferrous and non-ferrous metals.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Describe the composition and key properties of brass and bronze.
  2. List at least five common uses of brass in homes, industries, and arts.
  3. State at least five common uses of bronze in sculpture, engineering, and daily life.
  4. Compare the advantages of using brass versus bronze for specific applications.
  5. Recommend appropriate metal choice for given scenarios based on properties and uses.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays brass and bronze items and asks students to identify differences in colour and texture.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews the composition of brass (copper and zinc) and bronze (copper and tin, sometimes with other elements).

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains properties such as resistance to corrosion, malleability, conductivity, and aesthetic appeal, linking each property to typical uses.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups to match sample scenarios—like making musical instruments, ship propellers, door handles, medals, electrical fittings—to either brass or bronze and justify their choices.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher quizzes students on compositions, properties, and uses, and collects group worksheets summarising their decisions.

### Content Summary

1. **Brass** is an alloy of copper and zinc used for **musical instruments**, **door handles**, **plumbing fittings**, **decorative items**, and **electrical components** because it is malleable and corrosion resistant.
2. **Bronze** is an alloy of copper and tin used for **sculptures**, **ship propellers**, **bearings**, **coins**, and **medals** due to its hardness and durability.
3. Selecting brass or bronze depends on **required strength**, **resistance to corrosion**, **appearance**, and **cost**.

### Conclusion

Teacher highlights that understanding material properties helps engineers and artisans choose the right metals for different purposes.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Brass (copper + zinc) is used for **trumpets**, **door knobs**, **water taps**, **decorative plates**, and **electrical connectors**.
- Bronze (copper + tin) is used for **statues**, **ship propellers**, **bearings**, **coins**, and **art medals**.
- We choose brass or bronze by considering **corrosion resistance**, **strength**, and **appearance**.
- Create a quick summary in your notebook highlighting the key terms, diagrams, and examples from this lesson.
- Teach a friend or family member what you learned to check your understanding and build confidence.


### Assignment

Prepare a chart with two columns listing five brass products and five bronze products found in your community, stating one reason each material is suitable.
