- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Technology for JSS 2; Materials Science for Junior Secondary; Industrial Materials Catalogue
- **Instructional Materials:** Samples of rubber bands, plastic containers, ceramic tiles, glass jars, comparison charts, multimedia presentation showing manufacturing processes
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can identify different household items made from rubber, plastics, ceramics, or glass.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Describe the properties of rubber, plastics, ceramics, and glass that influence their uses.
  2. List at least five common uses for each material type in home, school, and industry.
  3. Compare advantages and limitations of each material for specific applications.
  4. Suggest appropriate materials for given products based on properties and usage conditions.
  5. Create a simple chart categorising items according to the material from which they are made.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays assorted items and asks students to group them by material type (rubber, plastic, ceramic, glass).

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews the properties of each material: elasticity of rubber, versatility of plastics, hardness of ceramics, transparency of glass.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses common uses—rubber (tyres, seals, footwear), plastics (containers, packaging, furniture), ceramics (plates, tiles, electrical insulators), glass (windows, laboratory apparatus, bottles)—highlighting why each material suits its uses.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups to match products to appropriate materials, evaluate advantages and disadvantages, and present findings using comparison charts.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on properties, asks them to justify material choices for specific products, and assesses their group charts.

### Content Summary

1. **Rubber** is flexible and elastic, making it useful for **tyres**, **belts**, **seals**, and **protective gear**.
2. **Plastics** are lightweight and mouldable, used for **containers**, **toys**, **pipes**, and **furniture**.
3. **Ceramics** are hard and heat-resistant, used for **plates**, **tiles**, **pots**, and **insulators**.
4. **Glass** is transparent and brittle, used for **windows**, **laboratory glassware**, **bulbs**, and **decorative items**.
5. Choosing materials depends on **properties**, **cost**, **durability**, and **intended use**.

### Conclusion

Teacher concludes that understanding material properties helps in selecting the best materials for safe, durable, and cost-effective products.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Materials have special properties that determine their uses.
- Rubber is **elastic**, plastics are **light and mouldable**, ceramics are **hard and heat-resistant**, and glass is **transparent**.
- We choose materials by considering the job the product will do and the environment where it will be used.
- Create a quick summary in your notebook highlighting the key terms, diagrams, and examples from this lesson.
- Teach a friend or family member what you learned to check your understanding and build confidence.


### Assignment

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains glass production: mixing silica sand with soda ash and limestone, melting in a furnace, forming (blowing, pressing, drawing), annealing, and finishing.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students analyse process flow charts, identify equipment used (kiln, furnace, moulds), discuss safety precautions (heat protection, ventilation), and match finished products to their uses (building materials, laboratory equipment, household items).

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to outline steps in ceramic and glass production, list uses, and mention safety measures during processing.

### Content Summary

1. Clay processing involves **mining**, **weathering**, **tempering**, **moulding**, **drying**, and **firing** to produce ceramics like bricks, tiles, and pottery.
