DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 24th September 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** First Aid
- **Subtopic:** Reasons for Administering First Aid and the ABC of First Aid
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; STAN Basic Technology Textbook for JSS 2; Red Cross First Aid Manual (Junior Edition)
- **Instructional Materials:** First aid box with bandages, triangular bandage, gloves, resuscitation chart, posters showing ABC of first aid
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have witnessed first aid being given during sports or at home.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. State at least four reasons for administering first aid.
  2. Explain the meaning of the ABC of first aid (Airway, Breathing, Circulation).
  3. Describe how to check and clear the airway of a casualty.
  4. Demonstrate how to assess breathing and circulation using simple procedures.
  5. Apply the ABC steps to given scenarios during role-play.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher narrates a scenario of a classmate who fainted during assembly and asks students what should be done first.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher discusses reasons for giving first aid such as saving life, preventing condition from worsening, relieving pain, and promoting recovery.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains each component of ABC: ensure airway is clear, check for breathing, and assess circulation/pulse; demonstrates with a volunteer.

**Step 4 – Application:** In small groups, students practise the ABC steps using mannequins or peers, guided by the teacher.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to list reasons for first aid, explain ABC, and perform the steps during a quick drill.

### Content Summary

1. First aid is given to **save life**, **prevent further harm**, **reduce pain**, and **promote recovery** before professional help arrives.
2. **A – Airway:** Ensure the casualty’s airway is open by tilting the head and lifting the chin, removing any obstruction.
3. **B – Breathing:** Look, listen, and feel for breathing; give rescue breaths if trained and necessary.
4. **C – Circulation:** Check for pulse or signs of circulation; apply chest compressions or control bleeding if required.
5. Practise ABC calmly and call for medical help immediately.

### Conclusion

Teacher reminds students that first aiders must stay calm, protect themselves with gloves, and follow the ABC steps while waiting for medical professionals.

### Student Lesson Notes

- We give **first aid** to save a life, stop the injury from getting worse, reduce pain, and help the person recover quickly.
- **A – Airway:** Make sure the mouth and throat are open and clear so air can pass.
- **B – Breathing:** Check if the person is breathing by looking at the chest, listening for air, and feeling breath on your cheek.
- **C – Circulation:** Look for signs of movement or pulse and control bleeding or start chest compressions if trained.
- Always call for help, use protective gloves, and keep the casualty comfortable while help is on the way.

### Assignment

Write a short procedure showing how you would apply the ABC of first aid to a classmate who collapsed during sports.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Timber can have defects like **knots**, **warping**, **twisting**, **shakes**, **splits**, and **termite attack**.
- These defects are caused by poor growth, wrong felling methods, improper drying, or attack by insects and fungi.
- Timber is treated by **seasoning**, **chemical preservatives**, **fumigation**, **painting**, or **varnishing** to make it strong and durable.
- Presenting timber for use involves **selecting good wood**, **seasoning it**, **treating it**, **smoothing the surface**, and **finishing** with paint, polish, or varnish.
- Proper processing ensures timber lasts longer and looks attractive in furniture and buildings.

### Assignment

Visit a nearby carpentry workshop or observe wooden furniture at home. List three defects you notice and suggest suitable treatments for each.
