  2. List at least five common uses of wood in everyday life.
  3. State at least five common uses of metals in the home, school, and industry.
  4. Explain why specific properties make wood or metal suitable for particular uses.
  5. Categorise given objects as wood or metal products based on their uses and properties.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays assorted wooden and metal objects and asks students to sort them by material type.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews the definition of materials and introduces wood and metals as important engineering materials.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses uses of wood such as building construction, furniture, packaging, tools, and decorative items. Teacher explains uses of metals like structural beams, machinery parts, cooking utensils, electrical wires, and vehicles, linking each use to properties like strength, conductivity, and durability.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students complete a worksheet matching wood or metal properties (lightweight, tough, conductive, corrosion-resistant) to the correct everyday application.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on examples and reasons for using wood or metal in specific situations.

### Content Summary

1. **Wood** is obtained from trees and is used for **building houses**, **making furniture**, **doors**, **window frames**, **pencils**, and **packaging crates** because it is workable, strong, and renewable.
2. **Metals** like **iron, steel, aluminium, copper, and brass** are used for **bridges**, **machines**, **vehicles**, **pots**, **roofing sheets**, and **electrical cables** due to their strength, conductivity, and resistance to wear.
3. Choosing materials depends on properties such as **strength**, **weight**, **resistance to corrosion**, **conductivity**, and **ease of shaping**.
4. Engineers select wood or metal to suit the **function**, **safety**, and **cost** requirements of the product.

### Conclusion
