3. Characteristic features of stages of development

  4. Classifying growth and developmental changes(Temporary and
  permanent

  chages).

SUB-TOPIC 1: Definition of growth and development

Growth is the permanent increase in size of an organism due to increase
in number of cells. Growth is brought about by cell division and depends
on the type of food taken.

Development is a series of orderly changes by which a living thing comes
into maturity .It is a series of changes that occur during growth .It is
a gradual process leading to maturation of organs and behaviours of
individual like social, emotional as well as skill acquisition.

Growth and developmental changes

The noticeable change in the body size over time is termed growth
change. Growth change can be determined by measure of height and weight
at time intervals while developmental changes can be observed by
appearance of certain characteristics features and capabilities.
Development leads to transition from one stage of life to another e.g a
baby develops from infancy to childhood, then to adolescence and to
adulthood. Developmental changes are progressive and move from simple to
complex.

Sub-topic 2

Characteristic features of developmental stages

The developmental changes are characterized by certain features which
include the following:

1. Infancy and childhood

Infancy is period of dramatic growth which last from birth to around two
years. It is also a time when children form emotional attachments to
their care givers e g mother. Childhood is the stage from birth to
puberty. After infancy, children can walk, run and speak in simple
sentences. Childhood is characterized by light body weight, small size,
very rapid growth particularly in the first two years of life very
active body and restlessness.

2 Puberty/Juvenile: This is the transition stage from childhood to
adolescence. As children approach the ages of 9 and 10 years, they
become more independent and might start noticing the physical changes of
puberty. A major growth spurt can occur at this time as the body begins
sexual development. This also can be a time of stress for children as
peer pressure takes its toll. Body image along with emotional changes
often causes children to feel less confident. Juveniles also start
preparing for middle school by taking on more academic responsibilities
and focusing on goal-setting and accomplishment

Sub-topic 3

3 Adolescence: This is the stage between adulthood. From ages 12 to 18
years, children experience distinct mental and physical changes.
According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the beginning of a
girl's menstrual cycle typically occurs 2 years after the onset of
puberty. The NIH reports that boys do not begin puberty with a distinct
marker and tend to mature with adult genitalia about age 16 or 17 years.
During this time of physical change, adolescents may become more
self-centered. In middle to late adolescence, teen-agers are often
characterized as becoming more comfortable with their body sexually and
ready to have romantic friendships. Adolescent behavior often includes
the teen-agers' need to pull away from parents and authority figures to
establish their own self-identity and make decisions on their own.

4 Adulthood: This is the stage of full maturity. It is often noted when
a person is considered chronologically, legally and behaviorally ready
to hold responsibilities such as operating a motor vehicle, voting,
taking the vows of marriage, entering into a contract and serving in the
armed forces. The process of becoming mature does not end with
adolescence but continues throughout adulthood as psychological, safety
and self-actualization needs are met. Adulthood is often divided into
three categories: young adulthood, middle age and old age.

Classifying growth and developmental changes (Temporary and permanent
changes)

Temporary changes:

These include growth of pimples in male and female at adolescence,
malnutrition or kwashiorkor, fatness, enlargement of stomach after a
meal or intake of water. These changes are usually due to food in-take.
Other temporary changes are bedwetting, sweating and rise in body
temperature .Temporary changes may naturally disappear after some time
.They can also be corrected medically or by change in behavior

Permanent changes: These are changes that remain for life and are not
reversible. Features that associated with each of the human
developmental stages of childhood, adolescence and adulthood are
permanent changes and remain with the individual throughout life.

Factors affecting growth and development

i. Food

ii. Heredity

iii. Exercise and rest

iv. Gland

v. Love and care

vi. Diseases.

EVALUATION:

Define growth and development.

List the human developmental stages.

List the factors affecting growth and development.

WEEKEND ASSIGNMENT: In STAN JSS 2 text book, write short notes on the
factors affecting growth and development.

WEEK 3

TOPIC: Changes in non-living things

CONTENTS: Types of changes in non-living things (Physical and chemical
changes

Characteristics of physical and chemical changes.

Sub-Topic 1: Types of changes in non living things

Non-living matter undergo changes i.e they can be made to change from
one state to another. They can be made to form new substances.

I.  Physical changes

II. Chemical changes

Physical changes: These are changes in which no new substances are
formed. A physical change is a temporary change. It is reversible .The
composition of the new substance does not change when undergoing a
physical change. Examples are:

1. Melting of candle wax.

2. Dissolution of salt in water to form a salt solution.

Salt + water ____________ salt solution

3 All changes of state of matter are physical changes.

i vapourization of liquid to gases

Ii.Melting of solids to liquids e.g ice to water

iii. Liquefaction of gases to liquids e.g cooking gas is liquefied under
pressure.

Iv . Sublimation of solids to vapours

V All processes of separation of mixture are physical changes e.g
distillation

Vi. Magnetization and demagnetization of iron.

Sub-Topic 2: Chemical changes:

These are changes in which new substances are formed. t is a permanent
change and not easily reversible. The composition of a substance changes
during the process of chemical change. Examples of chemical changes are:

1.  Burning of substance in air e.g burning of paper or wood.

2.  The rusting of iron.

3.  Dissolution of metals in or limestone in acids.

E.g. Zn + H₂SO₄------------🡪 ZnSO₄ +H₂

4. All processes of fermentation and decaying of substances are chemical
changes

5. The addition of water to calcium oxide

2. Functions of the skeleton

3. Parts of the body responsible for movement e.g

4. Bones, muscles and joints.

5. Importance of movement to human beings:

Sub-Topic 1: Human skeleton

Bones are of hard chemical materials called Calcium
(II)Tetraoxophosphate (IV), Calcium (II) Trioxocarbonate(IV).These are
living cells that can grow.

The parts of the body responsible for movement are bones, joints and
muscles. Human body is built on supporting framework of bones called
Skeleton. Skeletons are bony structures, which give animals rigidity,
support and also protect delicate organs of the body.

[C:\Users\Bro. Sunday\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet
Files\0010210f.bmp]

Human skeletal system

Skeleton could be divided into two main groups:

1 Axial skeleton

2 Appendicular skeleton

1 Axial skeleton

This consists of the skull, the vertebral column or back bones and the
rib cage.There are up to 80 bones

of axial skeleton.

[]. [][C:\Users\Bro. Sunday\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary
Internet Files\t012442a.bmp]

2 Appendicular skeleton. This consists of the bones of the limbs and
limb girdles. The limbs are the fore limbs (arms) and the hind limbs
(legs and feet).The girdles are the pectoral (shoulder) and the pelvic
girdles (hip).The appendicular skeleton has up to 126 bones.

Functions of the skeleton

1It provides support for the body.

2 it protects vital organs.

3 It gives shape to the body.

4 It provides surface for attachment of muscles for movement

5 Red blood cells are formed in the bone marrow.

6 Bones store salt (calcium and phosphorus).

Sub-Topic 2: Muscles and Joints

Muscles are bundles of elastic substance in an animal body. Muscles are
attached to bones by means of tendons. Muscles are made up of many tiny
cells, which are held together by thin strands of connective tissues .A
tight cord which holds bones together is called ligament. A flexible
connective tissue which is found between one vertebra and the other is
called Cartilage. It serves as shock absorber which prevents the bones
from wearing out.

Types of muscles

1 Skeletal muscle: These attached to the bones of the skeleton which
help to move.

2 Smooth muscles: These lined many structures in our body such as
intestine and blood vessels.

3 Cardiac muscles: Are special striped muscles with the ability to work
continuously.

Joints

The point where two bones meet is called a joint. The bones are actually
held together by rope-like materials called ligament.

Types of joints

1 Ball and socket joints: These allow free rotation of the bones e.g the
hip bones.

2 Pivot joint: This is found only in the neck bone. It allows the
rotation of the head on the neck. It also permits nodding and limited
bending movements.

3 Hinge joint: This allows movement in one direction only e.g elbow
joint.

4 Gliding /sliding joint: This allows the sliding, twisting or turning
of one bone over another e.g joints at the wrist, ankle joint.

5 Suture joint: This is found in the skull.

Sub-Topic 3: Importance of movement to human beings

Human beings move in order to

1 Look for food

2 For reproduction/sexual partner

3 To run away from danger.

4 To look for shelter and safety.

5 To respond to environment.

6 To celebrate with each other /attend social functions.

7 To practice profession of their choice to earn a living.

8 To keep themselves and their surroundings neat and tidy.

9 To enjoy themselves.

2 Parts of human respiratory system

3 Functions of the respiratory system

4 Problems associated with breathing

Sub-Topic 1: Meaning of respiration

Respiration is the process by which food substances are broken down in
our body to release energy. In big animals like human beings, air enters
the body through special organs. These organs are called respiratory
organs. Respiratory organs include ; Nostrils ,larynx ,pharynx
,trachea(wind pipe) ,bronchi ,lungs ,bronchioles ,alveoli ,and sometimes
mouths.

Parts of respiratory system

EVALUATION: i Define respiration

ii List five respiratory organs

Sub-Topic 2: Types of respiration

1 Aerobic respiration: This involves the use of oxygen to librate energy

C₆ H₁₂ O₆ + 6O₂ _________ 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + energy

Glucose Oxygen Carbon dioxide water

2 Anaerobic respirations: This involves a chemical process through which
energy is released in the absence of oxygen.

C₆H₁₂O_(6_________________) 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂ + energy

Glucose Ethanol Carbon dioxide

Functions of the respiratory system

The main functions of the respiratory system are:

1 Breathing [External respiration]

2 Cellular respiration [Internal respiration]

Breathing is the exchange of gases in which oxygen is breathed in and
carbon-dioxide is breathed out. Breathing is one of the stages in
respiration. Breathing supplies oxygen for respiration and takes away
carbon dioxide which is a poisonous end product of respiration, while
respiration is the process by which oxygen breathed in from the
atmosphere is used in breaking down food substance in our body cells to
release needed energy with carbon dioxide and water as the waste product

EVALUATION: Differentiate between breathing and respiration

Sub-Topic 2: Structure of the Heart

The Heart[C:\Users\Bro. Sunday\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary
Internet Files\00102565.bmp]

Heart is a muscular organ which has four chambers. The four chambers
consist of two upper chambers which are the right auricle and the left
auricle. The two lower chambers which are the right ventricle and the
left ventricle. Between the auricles and ventricles are two small
openings [valves].The openings between the left auricle and the left
ventricle is called the bicuspid valve while the opening between the
right auricle and the right ventricle is called the tricuspid valve. The
heart is located in the chest cavity of the body and is connected to all
parts of the body by means of blood vessels.

Functions of the heart

1 It is the organ for pumping blood to all parts of the body.

2 It keeps blood in continuous circulation.

3 Pumping action of the heart is known as heart beat, man has an average
of 72 heat beat per minute.

Blood Vessels: Blood moves around our body through tubes called blood
vessels. There are three main types of blood vessels on the human
circulatory system .These are arteries, veins and capillaries.
Arteries[C:\Users\Bro. Sunday\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary
Internet Files\0010256c.bmp]

Arteries carry blood away from the heart to all parts of the body.

Absorption of food.

Simple food test.

Sub-Topic 1: Definition of terms e. g digestion and digestive system
etc.

Digestion is the process by which food substances are broken down into
simple and soluble form that can be readily absorbed into the body.

Digestive system

All the parts of the body which work together to ensure digestion of
food are called the digestive system.

Ingestion: This is the taking in of food into the mouth.

Absorption: This process by which food from digestion is taken into the
animal body fluid.

Egestion: This is the process whereby undigested food is removed as
faeces through the anus from the body.

Parts of the digestive system

The digestive system consists of a long tube from the mouth to the anus
with various organs connected with it. The long tube is the alimentary
canal and is made up of the organs below:

+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

Sub-Topic 2: Digestion process at various stages

1 The mouth: Food is mixed with saliva from the salivary glands.Saliva
contains the enzyme ptyalin which starts the digestion of starch, and
converts it to maltose.The softened food is swallowed into the
oesophagus (gullet) as a small ball or bolus.

2 The oesophagus (gullet): It is a narrow tube which connects the mouth
to the stomach. Food that has been chewed and partially digested in the
mouth is pushed down the gullet into the stomach by the process of
peristalsis. Peristalsis is the motion by which food is pushed along the
gullet.

3 The stomach: The stomach is a sac-like organ. It is made up of
connective tissue which holds the organ together. The stomach secretes
which contains hydrochloric acid which stops starch digestion; enzyme
pepsin acts on proteins and converts it to peptone and enzyme rennin
coagulates milk. The semi-liquid and partly digested food in the stomach
is called chyme and passes into the first section of the small
intestine-duodenum.

4 Small Intestine: Pancreas in the small intestine secretes pancreatic
juice which contains enzymes lipase, tripsin and amylase that help to
digest fats and oil, protein and carbohydrates in the duodenum which is
the first section of the small intestine. Bile from the liver is stored
in the gall bladder, and enters the duodenum through bile duct. Bile
emulsifies fats .Digestion of food is completed in the small intestine.

5 Large Intestine: The part of the food reaching the large intestine is
waste materials, and is useless to the body. The large intestine absorbs
any water in the waste materials. The hard waste (faeces) is passed out
through the anus.

Sub-Topic 3: Absorption of food

At the end of the digestion all end products, vitamins, salts and water
are absorbed in the small intestine through special structures which
appear like small fingers on the wall of the intestine. They are called
villi. They help to increase the surface area of the small intestine for
absorption of food substance into the blood stream.

Simple food test

All food we eat can be classified into six types. They are
carbohydrates, vitamins, fats and oils, mineral salts, proteins and
water. All these food are chemical in nature. They can react with other
chemicals to produce new substances .The scientists use simple food
tests to identify food types or the contents of food materials.

WEEK: 8

TOPIC: REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM

CONTENTS: 1.Parts of Reproductive system (male and female) and their
functions.

2. Puberty

3. Secondary sexual characteristics

4. Importance of Reproduction

Sub-topic 1: Parts of Reproduction (male and female) and their functions

Reproduction is the ability of living organisms to produce young ones of
their kinds. Reproduction is one of the characteristics of living things
that ensure continuity of life.

TYPES OF REPRODUCUTION

There are two types of reproduction. These are (i) Asexual Reproduction:
This involves one individual forming new off-springs. Examples are (a)
Vegetative propagation in plants (b) Binary fission in amoeba (c)
Budding in Hydra and (d) Spore production in Mucor and Mushroom. (ii)
Sexual Reproduction: This involves mating of male and female in order to
give rise to new off-springs. All new life comes from cells i.e sex
cells. The male sex produces the male gametes (sperms or spermatozoa)
from testes, the reproductive organs. The female sex produces the female
gametes (ovum or egg cell) from the ovary, the female reproductive
organs.

Male Reproductive System Female Reproductive System.

Sub-Topic 3: Secondary Sexual Characteristics

Secondary sexual characteristics are features that distinguish the two
sexes of a species, but that are not directly part of the reproductive
system. In humans, secondary sexual characteristics include:

- Male

  - Growth of body hair, including underarm, abdominal, chest, and pubic
    hair. Loss of scalp hair androgenic alopecia can also occur

  - Greater mass of thigh muscles in front of the femur, rather than
    behind it as is typical in mature females

  - Growth of facial hair

  - Enlargement of larynx (Adam's apple) and deepening of voice
    Increased stature; adult males are taller than adult females, on
    average

  - Heavier skull and bone structure

  - Increased muscle mass and strength

  - Larger hands and feet than women, prepubescent boys and girls

  - Square face

  - Small waist, but wider than females

  - Broadening of shoulders and chest; shoulders wider than hips
    Increased secretions of oil and sweat glands, often causing acne and
    body odor Coarsening or rigidity of skin texture, due to less
    subcutaneous fat

  - Higher waist-to-hip ratio than prepubescent or adult females or
    prepubescent males, on average

  - Enlargement growth of the penis

- Female

  - Enlargement of breasts and erection of nipples. Growth of body hair,
    most prominently underarm and pubic hair

  - Greater development of thigh muscles behind the femur, rather than
    in front of it

  - Widening of hips; lower waist to hip ratio than adult males, on
    average

  - Smaller hands and feet than men

  - Rounder face

  - Smaller waist than men

  - Increased secretions of oil and sweat glands, often causing acne and
    body odor

  - Upper arms approximately 2 cm longer, on average, for a given height
    Changed distribution in weight and fat; more subcutaneous fat and
    fat deposits mainly around the buttocks, thighs and hips.

IMPORTANCE OF REPRODUCTION.

1. It creates next generation.

2. It maintains the unique identity of a species.

3. It creates variations in species.

4. New species facilitate evolution of organisms which is necessary for
survival as
environmental conditions keep on changing from time to time.

EVALUATION

1. What is Reproduction?

2. State the two types of Reproduction.

3. State four signs of puberty in girls.

4. Mention five signs of sexual characteristics in male.

5. Enumerate three importance of Reproduction.

Basic Science Project’ pages 60-62 and (ii) Basic Science (made easy)
Book Two pages 27-30.

WEEK: 9

JSS 2

TOPIC: EXCRETOTY SYSTEM

SUB-TOPIC

I. Meaning of Excretion

II. Excretory organs and their functions

  III. Excretion and the need for it

IV. Excretory Products/Wastes

Sub-Topic I: Meaning of Excretion

Excretion is the process by which an organism gets rid of metabolic
waste products from the body. These waste products, if they are not
removed, may be toxic and harmful to the body. Excretion can also be
defined as removal or elimination of substances absorbed by the
intestine that are not used for growth, repair or respiration. Removal
of undigested food (faeces) is not excretion, it is egestion. Excretion
is the removal of Carbondioxide and water produced during respiration.

EVALUATION

1. What is excretion?

2. Is excretion and egestion the same?

Sub-Topic 2: Excretory Organs and their Functions

The Excretory organs include: Kidneys, Skin, Lungs and Liver.

The Kidney: The kidney is the urinary system. Kidneys are two
bean-shaped organs located in the abdominal region of the body. They
help in removing urine from the body. Urine contains 96% water, 2% salt
and 2% urea.

[]

Functions of Kidney

1. It helps to remove the poisonous liquid wastes [urine] from the body

2. It purifies the body by removing toxic and harmful materials from the
blood

3. It helps to regulate the amount of water and salt in the body.

The Skin: The skin is the external part of the body and protects the
inner structures. The human skin is made up of two layers, namely (i)
The Epidermis: the very outer layer and (ii) The Dermis: The inner layer
otherwise called true skin.

FUNCTIONS OF THE SKIN

1. Skin protects the body from mechanical injury and bacterial
infections

2. It helps in temperature regulation, that is, layer of fat under the
skin act as insulator while evaporation of sweat cools the body.

3. Skin act as a sense organ, that is, it contains sensory cells that
makes one respond to the stimuli of touch, pains, pressure, coldness or
hotness.

The Lungs: Oxygen from the air breathed in is used during respiration by
our body cells. The waste gases such as carbon (iv) oxide and water
vapour are sent out into atmosphere through the lungs. The lungs excrete
carbon (iv) oxide and water vapour which are by-products of respiration.
The lungs function both as respiratory and as excretory organ

Files\t012333a.bmp]

The Liver: Liver, largest internal organ of the human body that performs
more than 500 different functions, all of which are essential to life.
It’s essential functions include helping the body to digest fats,
storing reserves of nutrients, filtering poisons and wastes from the
blood, synthesizing a variety of proteins, and regulating the levels of
many chemicals found in the bloodstream.

Functions of Liver

1. Liver helps in storing energy in form of glycogen

2. It produces bile for the digestion of lipids or fats

3. It helps in clearing toxic substances such as drugs and alcohol from
the blood stream

4. Vitamins are stored in the liver

5. Liver is the body’s chemical factory, that is, it produces several
important proteins found in the blood, globin and several other
chemicals that help in healing wound.

EVALUATION

1. Mention the four excretory organs we have

2. State the components of urine

3. Which of the organs is important? Support your answer with four
reasons.

Sub-Topic 3: The Need for Excretion

Excretion is the removal of harmful waste products of metabolic
activities from the human body. If this process of excretion does not
take place, wastes accumulate in the body and may poison or destroy the
body. The need for excretion includes the following:

i. It is necessary to remove toxic and harmful waste products from the
body

ii. To maintain salt content of the body

iii. To remove excess water from the body

Sub-Topic 4: Excretory Products/Wastes

The waste products removed by different excretory organs in man include:

+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Excretory Organs     | Waste products                                |
