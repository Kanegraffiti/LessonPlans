- State Scheme of Work for Second Term Basic Science
- Approved Basic Science textbooks for Junior Secondary Schools
Instructional Materials:
- Growth stage charts of human and plants
- Seedlings at different growth stages
- Whiteboard and marker
- Ruler for height measurement activity
Previous Knowledge:
- Learners have learnt characteristics of living things.
Entry Behaviour:
- Learners can mention that living things grow.
Behavioural Objectives:
By the end of the lesson, learners should be able to:
- define growth and development.
- differentiate growth from development.
- identify at least four signs of growth in living things.
- list factors that affect growth.
- state examples of growth stages in human beings or plants.
Lesson Presentations:
Step 1: Introduction/Set Induction
- Teacher displays pictures of child and adult, seedling and mature plant.
- Learners observe differences and respond to questions.
Step 2: Presentation/Teaching Steps
- Teacher explains growth as increase in size/mass and development as improvement in complexity and function.
- Teacher presents examples from humans, animals, and plants.
- Teacher discusses factors affecting growth: food, water, light, heredity, hormones, and health.
Step 3: Learners’ Activities
- Learners compare two growth-stage pictures and list observed differences.
- Learners participate in a short class discussion on factors affecting growth.
- Learners copy board summary.
Step 4: Summary/Board Summary
- Meaning of growth and development.
- Differences between growth and development.
- Factors influencing growth.
Lesson Content:
Meaning of Growth
- Growth is a permanent increase in size, height, or mass of a living thing.

Meaning of Development
- Development is a progressive change in structure, ability, and function.

Differences Between Growth and Development
- Growth is quantitative and measurable.
- Development is qualitative and functional.

Factors Affecting Growth
- Nutrition.
- Water supply.
- Sunlight (for plants).
- Heredity/genetic factors.
- Hormones and good health care.
Evaluation:
1. Define growth.
2. Define development.
3. State two differences between growth and development.
4. List four factors that affect growth.
5. Give two examples each of growth in plants and humans.
6. Why is nutrition important in growth?
Conclusion:
- Teacher concludes that growth and development are essential life processes in all living things.
Assignment:
1. Write and explain three differences between growth and development.
2. List five factors affecting growth and state their effects.
3. Draw and label stages of growth in a bean plant.

Duration: 40 minutes
Period: 2nd Period
Subject: Basic Science
Topic: Changes in Living Things
Subtopic: Life processes and growth stages in living things
Reference Materials:
- NERDC Basic Science Curriculum for Upper Basic Education (JSS2)
- State Scheme of Work for Second Term Basic Science
- Approved Basic Science textbooks for Junior Secondary Schools
Instructional Materials:
- Chart of life cycle of butterfly/frog
- Human growth stages chart
- Whiteboard, marker, and flash cards
Previous Knowledge:
- Learners can define growth and development.
Entry Behaviour:
- Learners can mention one stage in human life cycle.
Behavioural Objectives:
By the end of the lesson, learners should be able to:
- list major stages in human growth.
- describe growth stages in one plant or animal.
- explain at least three life processes related to growth.
- identify healthy habits that support proper development.
- arrange growth stages in correct sequence.
Lesson Presentations:
Step 1: Introduction/Set Induction
- Teacher revises Contact 1 with oral questions.
- Teacher displays a life cycle chart and asks learners to arrange stages.
Step 2: Presentation/Teaching Steps
- Teacher teaches stages of human growth: infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, old age.
- Teacher explains life cycles in plants/animals.
- Teacher links life processes (feeding, respiration, excretion, reproduction) to development.
- Teacher highlights healthy habits: balanced diet, exercise, rest, hygiene.
Step 3: Learners’ Activities
- Learners arrange shuffled stage cards in sequence.
- Learners explain one growth stage in groups.
- Learners answer guided application questions.
Step 4: Summary/Board Summary
- Growth stages in humans.
- Life cycles in plants/animals.
- Healthy habits for proper growth.
Lesson Content:
Human Growth Stages
- Infancy.
- Childhood.
- Adolescence.
- Adulthood.
- Old age.

Growth in Plants/Animals
- Plant: seed, germination, seedling, mature plant, flowering/fruiting.
- Animal example: egg, larva/tadpole, pupa (where applicable), adult.

Life Processes Supporting Growth
- Nutrition provides energy and body-building materials.
- Respiration releases energy for body activities.
- Excretion removes waste products.
- Reproduction ensures continuity of life.

Healthy Development Habits
- Eat balanced diet.
- Maintain personal hygiene.
- Sleep adequately.
- Avoid harmful substances.
Evaluation:
1. List the stages of human growth.
2. Arrange these in order: adulthood, infancy, adolescence, childhood.
3. State three life processes that support growth.
4. Describe growth stages of a flowering plant.
5. Mention four healthy habits for proper development.
6. Explain why adolescence is a special growth stage.
Conclusion:
- Teacher emphasizes that growth follows stages and can be improved through healthy living.
Assignment:
1. Write and explain the stages of human growth.
2. Draw and label the life cycle of a butterfly or frog.
3. List four life processes and state one function of each.
4. Explain three habits that can hinder healthy development.
