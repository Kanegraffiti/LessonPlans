DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 1
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Monday, 22nd September 2025
- **Class:** JSS 1
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** First
- **Topic:** Family Health – Nutrition
- **Subtopic:** Meaning, Importance, and Classes of Nutrition
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 1; MAN Basic Science Textbook for JSS 1; Food and Nutrition for Junior Secondary Schools
- **Instructional Materials:** Food samples or pictures representing major nutrient classes, food pyramid chart, balanced diet poster
- **Entry Behaviour:** Pupils eat different meals at home and can mention favourite foods.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, pupils will be able to:
  1. Define nutrition and balanced diet correctly.
  2. State at least four reasons why proper nutrition is important for family health.
  3. Identify six classes of food nutrients and give common examples of each.
  4. Group sample foods into their correct nutrient classes during class activity.
  5. Explain how a balanced diet supports growth, energy, and disease prevention.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays pictures of different meals and asks pupils to describe the foods and how they feel after eating balanced meals versus junk food.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines nutrition as the process of taking in food and using it for growth, energy, and repair; introduces the concept of balanced diet.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses the importance of nutrition in promoting growth, providing energy, protecting against diseases, and supporting healthy body functions.

**Step 4 – Application:** Pupils work in groups to classify food samples into carbohydrates, proteins, fats and oils, vitamins, minerals, and water; each group explains their choices.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks pupils to define nutrition, list the classes of food nutrients, and mention two reasons why good nutrition is vital.

### Content Summary

1. **Nutrition** is the process by which the body takes in and uses food for growth, energy, and repair.
2. Good nutrition is important because it **supports growth**, **provides energy**, **protects against disease**, and **helps the body function well**.
3. Classes of food nutrients: **carbohydrates**, **proteins**, **fats and oils**, **vitamins**, **minerals**, and **water**.
4. A **balanced diet** contains the right amounts of all nutrient classes to keep the body healthy.

### Conclusion

Teacher emphasises that eating a balanced diet daily keeps the family strong and healthy and advises pupils to include different nutrients in their meals.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Nutrition** means the way our bodies use food to grow, get energy, and stay healthy.
- We need good nutrition to **grow well**, **fight diseases**, **repair worn-out tissues**, and **stay active**.
- Food nutrients include **carbohydrates** (rice, yam), **proteins** (beans, eggs, fish), **fats and oils** (groundnut oil, butter), **vitamins** (fruits, vegetables), **minerals** (milk, liver), and **water**.
- A **balanced diet** has the right amount of each nutrient class; skipping any class can make us weak or sick.
- Eat a colourful plate by combining **carbohydrate staples with vegetables, fruits, and protein-rich foods** to keep meals balanced.
- Drink plenty of **clean water** every day because it helps nutrients move around the body and removes waste.

### Assignment

Write out a one-day menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner showing foods that supply all the six classes of nutrients.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 24th September 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Living Things – Habitats
- **Subtopic:** Adaptations of Living Things in Their Habitats
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; STAN Basic Science for Junior Secondary Schools Book 2; Illustrated Guide to Ecosystems
- **Instructional Materials:** Charts of different habitats, video clips of animal and plant adaptations, specimens or models of camel, duck, water lily
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students know that living things need food, water, and shelter to survive.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Define adaptation as a special feature or behaviour that helps an organism survive in its habitat.
  2. Describe adaptive features of selected animals and plants in desert, aquatic, and forest habitats.
  3. Explain how adaptations help organisms obtain food, conserve water, or escape predators.
  4. Match organisms to their habitats and adaptive features during group activities.
  5. Analyse how changes in habitat can affect the survival of living things.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher plays a short video showing animals in different environments and asks students to note special features they observe.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines adaptation and gives examples of structural, behavioural, and physiological adaptations.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains adaptations such as camel humps for fat storage, thick fur for cold, webbed feet for swimming, and plant features like waxy leaves and prop roots.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups with habitat charts to match organisms with adaptive features and explain how each feature supports survival.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher conducts oral questioning on the meaning of adaptation, examples from different habitats, and the importance of adaptations.

### Content Summary

1. An **adaptation** is a special body part or behaviour that helps an organism survive in its habitat.
2. Examples: **camels** store fat in humps and have long eyelashes to protect against sand; **ducks** have webbed feet for swimming; **cacti** have thick stems to store water; **mangrove plants** have prop roots for support.
3. Adaptations help organisms to **obtain food**, **escape predators**, **conserve water**, and **cope with environmental conditions**.
4. When habitats change, organisms may migrate, adapt further, or risk extinction.

### Conclusion

Teacher summarises key adaptations discussed and encourages students to observe how plants and animals around them survive in their habitats.

### Student Lesson Notes

- An **adaptation** is a special way a plant or animal is built or behaves that helps it live in its home.
- Examples: **Camels** have humps to store fat and long eyelashes to keep out sand; **ducks** have webbed feet for swimming; **fish** have gills to breathe in water; **cacti** have spines that reduce water loss.
- Adaptations allow living things to get food, stay safe, and cope with heat, cold, or water.
- If the habitat changes too much, living things must move, adapt more, or they may die.
- Some adaptations are **behavioural**, like birds migrating when seasons change, while others are **structural**, like thick fur for warmth.
- Sketch or label pictures of organisms showing their adaptations to remember how each feature helps them survive.

### Assignment

Choose one habitat (desert, aquatic, forest, or grassland) and describe three organisms that live there, explaining one adaptation for each.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Friday, 26th September 2025
- **Class:** JSS 3
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Third
- **Topic:** Family Traits
- **Subtopic:** Meaning of Dominance and Recessive Traits
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 3; Spectrum Basic Science for Junior Secondary Schools Book 3; Simple Genetics Charts
- **Instructional Materials:** Family trait charts, pedigree diagram, flash cards showing dominant and recessive traits, mirrors
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can mention physical features shared with parents or siblings.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Define dominant trait and recessive trait with clear examples.
  2. Explain how dominant traits mask recessive traits in offspring.
  3. Identify dominant and recessive traits from family trait charts.
  4. Use simple Punnett square examples to show inheritance of dominant and recessive traits.
  5. Record their own observable traits and classify them as dominant or recessive.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher asks students to compare eye colour, earlobe type, and dimples among classmates and note similarities.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines dominant traits as strong traits that show when present and recessive traits as hidden traits that appear only when inherited from both parents.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher uses Punnett square examples to show how dominant (e.g. D) and recessive (e.g. d) genes combine to produce traits; demonstrates with traits such as dimples (dominant) and no dimples (recessive).

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups to complete simple Punnett squares and classify classroom traits as dominant or recessive.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher assesses students through oral questions on definitions, examples, and Punnett square outcomes.

### Content Summary

1. **Dominant traits** are strong traits that show in an offspring even if only one parent passes them on.
2. **Recessive traits** are hidden traits that appear only when inherited from both parents.
3. When a dominant gene is paired with a recessive gene, the dominant trait masks the recessive one.
4. Punnett squares help us predict how traits are inherited from parents to children.

### Conclusion

Teacher recaps the meaning of dominant and recessive traits and encourages students to discuss family traits with parents to understand inheritance better.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Dominant traits** (like dimples, free earlobes, rolling tongue) show easily because the dominant gene is strong.
- **Recessive traits** (like attached earlobes, straight hairline, inability to roll the tongue) appear only when both parents pass the recessive gene.
- A dominant gene written with a capital letter hides a recessive gene written with a small letter when they are together.
- Using simple **Punnett squares** helps us see the chances of children inheriting certain traits from their parents.
- When reading family charts, note that **dominant traits do not disappear**; they may skip appearing if paired with another dominant gene but can reappear in later generations.
- Observe members of your family and record which traits are dominant or recessive to practise explaining inheritance in real life.

### Assignment

Draw two Punnett squares to show how dominant and recessive traits are inherited for dimples (D) and no dimples (d). Explain the outcome of each cross.
