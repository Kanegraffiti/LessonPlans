  2. Describe special human features such as complex brain function, speech, and upright posture.
  3. Identify social and cultural behaviours that reflect human uniqueness.
  4. Relate human creativity and technology to problem-solving in society.
  5. Appreciate the responsibilities that come with being human in caring for the environment and others.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher asks students to compare humans with other animals and list features they think are different.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews general characteristics of living things and introduces the concept of human uniqueness.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains unique human features such as a well-developed brain enabling reasoning and memory, ability to speak and use complex language, opposable thumbs for precise work, upright posture for walking and using tools, and development of culture, morals, and technology.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students form groups to create posters showing one unique human ability (e.g., inventing machines, writing books, building communities) and present how it benefits society.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on human special features and their responsibilities towards others and the environment.

### Content Summary

1. Humans are unique because of their **highly developed brains**, **complex language**, and **ability to think and plan**.
2. Special features include **upright posture**, **opposable thumbs**, and **skilled hands** for making tools and art.
3. Humans build **societies, cultures, laws, and technology** that improve living conditions.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows a short video of a flooded community and asks students to share what challenges the people might face.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines flooding as the overflow of water onto normally dry land and introduces types such as river, coastal, and flash floods.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains causes including heavy rainfall, blocked drainage, dam failure, deforestation, poor urban planning, and climate change. Preventive measures include desilting drains, building embankments, planting trees, proper town planning, and early warning systems. Effects include destruction of homes, loss of crops and livestock, spread of diseases, displacement of people, and economic losses.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students design a community flood preparedness plan outlining preventive steps, emergency supplies, and evacuation routes for a given local scenario.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Flooding is **water covering normally dry land** due to **heavy rain or blocked drains**.
- Human actions like **dumping waste in gutters** and **building on waterways** make flooding worse.
- Prevention includes **clearing drains**, **planting trees**, **building embankments**, and **following weather alerts**.
- Flooding damages **homes, farms, roads, and health**, so communities must **prepare and respond quickly**.
- Keep emergency contacts and supplies ready, such as **clean water, first-aid kits, and dry food**, to stay safe during heavy rains.
- Support community projects that **desilt gutters, protect wetlands, and enforce proper building plans** to reduce future floods.

### Assignment

Interview an adult in your community about a past flood experience. Record the causes, effects, and lessons learnt to share in class.
