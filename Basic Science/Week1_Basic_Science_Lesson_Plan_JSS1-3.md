**Step 3 – Explanation:** The teacher discusses the importance of sanitation such as disease prevention, neat appearance, and environmental safety, while students take notes.

**Step 4 – Application:** In groups, students list methods of sanitation practiced in their families and role-play the correct use of sanitation tools.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** The teacher asks students to define sanitation, mention two importance, and outline two methods of sanitation, checking individual responses.

### Content Summary

1. Sanitation means keeping our surroundings clean and free from germs.
2. Importance: prevents diseases, promotes comfort, keeps the environment attractive.
3. Methods: sweeping, mopping, waste disposal in covered bins, clearing drains, handwashing after chores.

### Conclusion

The teacher revises key points on sanitation and encourages students to practice good cleaning habits at home.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Sanitation** means keeping our homes, classrooms, and surroundings clean so that germs cannot grow.
- A **germ** is a tiny living thing that causes sickness; cleaning and washing stop germs from spreading.
- We clean to **prevent diseases**, make places **comfortable to live in**, and keep everyone **safe and healthy**.
- Common sanitation methods include **sweeping floors**, **mopping with clean water**, **washing hands with soap**, **packing refuse into covered bins**, and **clearing gutters or drains** so water can flow freely.
- Keeping **gutters and drains clear** stops stagnant water from collecting and prevents mosquitoes and other pests from spreading diseases like malaria.
- Practise sanitation every day by **wiping surfaces, washing clothes and dishes regularly, storing food properly**, and reminding family members to clean shared spaces.

### Assignment

Write in your notebooks five sanitation tools used at home and state one use for each.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 17th September 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Living Things
- **Subtopic:** Habitat and Adaptation
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; STAN Basic Science for Junior Secondary Schools Book 2
- **Instructional Materials:** Habitat charts (forest, desert, aquatic), specimens of cactus and water lily images, video clip of animal adaptations, globe
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have learnt that living things need food, water, and shelter to survive.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Define habitat accurately.
  2. Mention at least four examples of habitats.
  3. Describe how selected plants and animals adapt to their habitats.
  4. Classify given organisms according to their habitats in group tasks.
  5. Explain the importance of adaptation for survival using relevant examples.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows pictures of different environments and asks students to name the organisms that live there.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines habitat and gives examples such as forest, desert, aquatic, and arboreal habitats.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains adaptations like camel humps for water storage, webbed feet of ducks for swimming, and cactus spines for water conservation while students note key points.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups to match organisms to their correct habitats and state one adaptive feature for each.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher assesses students through oral questions on meaning of habitat, examples, and adaptations discussed.

### Content Summary

1. Habitat is the natural home of an organism where it finds food, water, shelter, and mates.
2. Examples of habitats: forest, desert, freshwater, marine, grassland, arboreal.
3. Adaptations help living things survive, e.g. giraffe long neck for browsing, fish gills for breathing in water.

### Conclusion

Teacher reviews main ideas on habitats and adaptations and urges students to observe living things around their environments.

### Student Lesson Notes

- A **habitat** is the natural home of a plant or animal where it finds food, water, air, and shelter.
- Examples of habitats are **forest** (many trees and animals), **desert** (hot, dry land with little water), **freshwater** (rivers and ponds), **marine** (seas and oceans), and **arboreal** (tree tops where animals like monkeys live).
- An **adaptation** is a special body part or behaviour that helps a living thing survive in its habitat, such as **camel humps storing fat**, **duck webbed feet for swimming**, **cactus spines reducing water loss**, or **fish gills for breathing in water**.
- Living things must match their adaptations to the right habitat so that they can get what they need and stay alive.
- When habitats change, organisms may **migrate, adapt further, or risk dying out**, so protecting habitats keeps living things safe.
- Draw a table in your notebook listing **organism, habitat, and adaptation** to help you remember how each example survives.

### Assignment

List three organisms that live in each of the following habitats: forest, desert, and freshwater. Describe one adaptation for each organism.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Friday, 19th September 2025
- **Class:** JSS 3
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Third
- **Topic:** Family Traits
- **Subtopic:** Dominant and Recessive Traits
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 3; Spectrum Basic Science for Junior Secondary Schools Book 3
- **Instructional Materials:** Family trait chart, pictures showing eye colour variations, sample pedigree chart, mirror
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can identify simple physical features among family members.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Identify common family traits shared among relatives.
  2. Explain the meaning of dominant traits with examples.
  3. Explain the meaning of recessive traits with examples.
  4. Distinguish between dominant and recessive traits using a family trait chart.
  5. Record their own observable traits in a simple table.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher asks students to mention traits they share with their parents or siblings.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher lists family traits such as dimples, earlobe types, eye colour, and tongue rolling on the board.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher defines dominant traits as those that appear more frequently and recessive traits as those hidden unless paired together, giving examples like free earlobes (dominant) and attached earlobes (recessive).

**Step 4 – Application:** Students examine themselves using mirrors, record their traits, and classify them as dominant or recessive in groups.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to differentiate between dominant and recessive traits and provide personal examples.

### Content Summary

1. Family traits are inherited characteristics passed from parents to children.
2. Dominant traits show up when present in one parent, e.g. dimples, rolling tongue.
3. Recessive traits appear only when inherited from both parents, e.g. attached earlobes, straight hairline.

### Conclusion

Teacher summarises the meaning of family traits, dominant traits, and recessive traits, encouraging students to discuss their findings with their families.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Family traits** are physical or behavioural features passed from parents to children, such as eye colour or dimples.
- A **dominant trait** is a strong trait that shows even if it comes from only one parent. Examples: free earlobes, the ability to roll the tongue, dimples.
- A **recessive trait** is a hidden trait that shows only when it is received from both parents. Examples: attached earlobes, straight hairline, inability to roll the tongue.
- **Genes** are tiny instructions inside cells that carry traits from parents to children and decide whether a trait is dominant or recessive.
- Members of the same family can look alike or different because they receive different combinations of genes from their parents.
- Keep a **simple family trait chart** where you record relatives who show dominant or recessive traits to see patterns more clearly.
- Remember that **environmental factors** like nutrition and exercise can influence how traits appear, even when genes stay the same.

### Assignment

Interview two family members to list five family traits in your family. Indicate which ones are dominant and which are recessive.
