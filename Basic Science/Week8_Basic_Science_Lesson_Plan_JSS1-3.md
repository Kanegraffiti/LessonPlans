- **Subtopic:** Meanings of Matter; States of Matter; Meaning and Characteristics of Living and Non-living Things; Examples
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 1; Illustrated Junior Science Dictionary; Teacher-prepared charts on matter and living things
- **Instructional Materials:** Samples of solids, liquids, and gases (e.g., stone, water in a sealed jar, inflated balloon), pictures of plants, animals, rocks, and machines, sorting cards, multimedia slide showing characteristics of living things
- **Entry Behaviour:** Pupils can name common objects around them and have previously heard about matter in basic science lessons.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, pupils will be able to:
  1. Define matter and identify its three common states with examples.
  2. Explain the meaning of living and non-living things in their own words.
  3. List at least seven characteristics of living things and contrast them with features of non-living things.
  4. Sort classroom objects into living and non-living categories, giving reasons for each placement.
  5. Compose a short description comparing two items, highlighting why one is living and the other is non-living.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays samples of solid, liquid, and gas and asks pupils to describe what is common to all the samples (they all occupy space and have mass).

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines matter and explains that matter exists in three main states—solid, liquid, and gas—giving familiar examples for each state.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher introduces living and non-living things, describes characteristics of living things (movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, reproduction, excretion, nutrition), and contrasts them with features of non-living things.

**Step 4 – Application:** Pupils work in groups to sort picture cards into living and non-living categories, then state whether each example is solid, liquid, or gas, and justify their answers using characteristics of living things.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks pupils to explain the difference between matter and living things, list characteristics of living things, and give examples of non-living things that are solids, liquids, or gases.

### Content Summary

1. **Matter** is anything that has mass and occupies space. It exists in the **solid**, **liquid**, or **gaseous** state.
2. **Living things** are organisms that show characteristics such as **movement**, **respiration**, **sensitivity**, **growth**, **reproduction**, **excretion**, and **nutrition**.
3. **Non-living things** do not carry out life processes on their own; examples include rocks, tables, water, and air.
4. Knowing the characteristics of living things helps us classify objects correctly and care for living organisms responsibly.

### Conclusion

Teacher emphasises that all living things are matter, but not all matter is living, and understanding the characteristics of living things helps us protect plants and animals.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Matter is anything that **has mass and occupies space**. It can be a **solid**, **liquid**, or **gas**.
- Living things show life processes like **movement**, **breathing**, **response to stimuli**, **growth**, **reproduction**, **excretion**, and **feeding**.
- Non-living things do not perform life processes. Examples are **stones**, **water**, **air**, and **machines**.
- We classify objects by checking for life characteristics and by identifying their state of matter.
- Practise by **sorting household items** into living and non-living groups and explaining your reasons to a friend or family member.
- Draw diagrams of **solid, liquid, and gas particles** to remember how matter behaves differently in each state.

### Assignment

Draw two columns labelled “Living Things” and “Non-living Things.” List five examples in each column and state the state of matter for each example.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 5th November 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Living Things
- **Subtopic:** Indices of Current Changes in Living Things; Stages in the Development of Humans
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; Human Biology Charts; Health Education Pamphlets on Growth and Development
- **Instructional Materials:** Growth charts, pictures showing stages of human development, measuring tape, weighing scale (if available), case study cards, projector with slideshow on developmental milestones
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can recall the basic characteristics of living things and have observed changes in themselves over time.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Explain what is meant by indices of current changes in living things.
  2. Identify measurable indicators such as height, weight, body temperature, and heartbeat that show changes in living things.
  3. Describe the stages of human development from infancy to adulthood with key features of each stage.
  4. Interpret a sample growth chart to determine if a person is growing healthily.
  5. Outline ways to maintain healthy growth and development during adolescence.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher asks students to reflect on how they have changed since primary school in terms of height, weight, and abilities.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines indices of current changes in living things as measurable signs that show growth, development, and adaptation, including size, weight, temperature, pulse, and behavioural changes.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher presents the stages of human development—infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age—highlighting physical, emotional, and social changes at each stage.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work with growth chart data to plot height and weight over time, analyse case study cards showing developmental milestones, and discuss healthy habits (nutrition, exercise, hygiene, rest) that support proper growth.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on indices of change, asks them to match characteristics to stages of development, and assesses their ability to interpret growth chart information.

### Content Summary

1. **Indices of current changes** are measurable signs—such as **height**, **weight**, **temperature**, **pulse rate**, and **behaviour**—that show that living things are growing or adapting.
2. Human development occurs in stages: **infancy**, **childhood**, **adolescence**, **adulthood**, and **old age**, each with unique physical and emotional changes.
3. Healthy development requires **balanced nutrition**, **regular exercise**, **good hygiene**, **adequate rest**, and **positive social relationships**.
4. Monitoring indices helps detect growth problems early and supports proper care for individuals at different stages.

### Conclusion

Teacher reinforces that observing indices of change helps individuals and health professionals track growth and respond to developmental needs appropriately.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Living things show changes that we can measure, such as **increase in height and weight**, **changes in body temperature**, and **faster or slower heartbeat**.
- Humans develop through **infancy**, **childhood**, **adolescence**, **adulthood**, and **old age**, each with special features.
- Good nutrition, exercise, sleep, and hygiene help us grow healthily during every stage.
- Keeping records of growth helps doctors and families ensure proper development.
- Use a personal health journal to **track height, weight, and habits**, noting how changes make you feel.
- Talk about **emotional and social changes** during each stage with trusted adults to learn healthy ways to manage them.

### Assignment

Create a simple table showing five indices of change in living things. For each index, describe how it can be measured and why it is important during human development.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows images of lush forests and deforested land, asking students to identify differences and predict consequences.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines deforestation as the large-scale removal of forest cover and explains methods such as logging, slash-and-burn agriculture, mining, and infrastructural development.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses reasons for deforestation, including demand for timber, agricultural expansion, urbanisation, fuelwood collection, and infrastructural projects, and highlights the effects on climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, water cycles, and local livelihoods.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students examine case studies of deforestation in Nigeria and other countries, identify the causes and effects, review relevant regulations (e.g., National Forest Policy, international agreements like REDD+), and design community action plans promoting reforestation and sustainable practices.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to define deforestation, list reasons and effects, cite at least two regulations, and suggest ways communities can mitigate deforestation.

### Content Summary

1. **Deforestation** is the removal of forest cover, often through **logging**, **burning**, **mining**, or **agricultural expansion**.
2. People clear forests for **timber**, **farmland**, **settlements**, **roads**, **mining**, and **fuelwood**.
3. Effects of deforestation include **climate change**, **loss of biodiversity**, **soil erosion**, **flooding**, **desertification**, and **loss of livelihoods**.
4. Regulations such as **forest reserves**, **logging permits**, **reforestation programmes**, and **international agreements (e.g., REDD+)** aim to control deforestation.
5. Communities can plant trees, support sustainable farming, report illegal logging, and participate in conservation education to protect forests.

### Conclusion

Teacher concludes that sustainable management of forests is essential for environmental stability, economic development, and the well-being of future generations.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Deforestation happens when people **remove trees and forest cover** for farming, logging, mining, or building.
- It leads to **climate change**, **loss of animals and plants**, **soil erosion**, and **reduced rainfall**.
- Governments regulate deforestation through **laws, permits, forest reserves, and reforestation projects**.
- Everyone can help by **planting trees**, **using alternative energy**, and **reporting illegal logging**.
- Support tree-planting clubs, community nurseries, or environmental campaigns that **replace harvested trees with new seedlings**.
- Learn about **sustainable products** such as certified timber or recycled paper to reduce pressure on natural forests.

### Assignment
