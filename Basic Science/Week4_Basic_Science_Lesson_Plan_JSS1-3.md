### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows pictures of medicines and illegal substances and asks pupils to share how drugs should be used correctly.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines drug abuse as the wrong or harmful use of drugs or substances without medical advice.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses examples of abused substances (e.g., cough syrups, painkillers, alcohol, tobacco, hard drugs) and explains physical, emotional, and social effects such as illness, addiction, family conflict, poor academic performance, and crime.

**Step 4 – Application:** Groups perform short role-plays showing peer pressure situations and how to refuse drugs politely and firmly.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Drug abuse means using drugs the **wrong way** or **without medical advice**.
- Abused substances like **alcohol, tobacco, tramadol, and cough syrups** can harm the body and mind.
- Drug abuse leads to **sickness**, **addiction**, **poor behaviour**, and **family quarrels**.
- Say **no** to drugs, follow doctors’ instructions, and report suspicious drug activities.
- Learn to **read medicine labels carefully** and only take doses given by a trusted adult or health worker.
- Build strong friendships that **support healthy choices** and practise what to say when someone offers you harmful substances.

### Assignment

Write a short paragraph explaining how you would advise a friend who is being pressured to take drugs. Mention two consequences of drug abuse and two refusal strategies.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 8th October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Living Things – Habitat Similarities
- **Subtopic:** Characteristics of Organisms in the Same Habitat and Shared Features
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; Illustrated Biology of African Habitats; Field Observation Guide
- **Instructional Materials:** Habitat charts (pond, forest, savannah, desert), organism picture cards, magnifying glasses, comparison worksheets
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can describe examples of habitats and name organisms living in their local environment.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. List at least three characteristics shared by organisms living in the same habitat.
  2. Explain how shared features support survival in that habitat.
  3. Compare similarities between organisms from two different habitats.
  4. Construct a chart showing shared and unique features of habitat organisms.
  5. Present findings on habitat adaptations to the class.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays habitat charts and asks students to match organisms to their natural homes.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews the meaning of a habitat and introduces the idea that similar environments produce similar adaptations.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher describes shared characteristics such as body covering, feeding habits, breathing organs, modes of movement, and reproductive behaviours among organisms living together.

**Step 4 – Application:** Groups analyse assigned habitat cards, list organisms found there, and record at least three shared features that support survival; groups display their charts for peer review.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to identify shared characteristics for a given habitat and explain why those features are important.

### Content Summary

1. A **habitat** is the natural home where organisms obtain food, water, shelter, and mates.
2. Organisms in the same habitat share features like **body coverings**, **feeding styles**, **respiratory organs**, and **behavioural patterns**.
3. Shared features help organisms **survive climate conditions**, **find food**, **protect themselves**, and **reproduce**.
4. Comparing habitats shows how environmental conditions influence the characteristics of living things.

### Conclusion

Teacher stresses that organisms sharing a habitat often look or behave alike because they face similar environmental challenges.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Habitats provide all the things organisms need to **live and reproduce**.
- Shared characteristics include **protective coverings**, **special feeding structures**, and **movement styles** suited to the habitat.
- These features help organisms **survive dangers** and **raise their young**.
- When habitats change, organisms may **adapt**, **migrate**, or **die** if they cannot cope.
- Keep a simple table showing **organism, shared feature, and survival advantage** to organise your observations.
- Compare two habitats in your notes to explain why animals or plants in each place need similar body parts or behaviours.

### Assignment

Observe a nearby habitat (pond, garden, refuse dump, etc.). List four organisms you find there and describe one characteristic they share that helps them survive.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Thursday, 9th October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 3
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Third
- **Topic:** Environmental Hazards – Erosion
- **Subtopic:** Definition, Causes, and Control of Soil Erosion
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 3; Environmental Management Textbook; Local Government Soil Conservation Manual
- **Instructional Materials:** Pictures of eroded sites, soil samples, charts showing erosion control methods, video clip on gully erosion
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have seen or heard of erosion affecting roads, farms, or neighbourhoods within their community.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Define soil erosion.
  2. State at least four causes of soil erosion.
  3. Describe three types of erosion (sheet, rill, and gully) with examples.
  4. Explain five methods of controlling or preventing soil erosion.
  5. Propose community actions to reduce erosion and protect the environment.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows photographs of gully erosion and asks students to share experiences of erosion in their area.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines soil erosion as the washing away or removal of the topsoil by agents like water and wind.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher outlines causes such as heavy rainfall, deforestation, overgrazing, poor farming practices, construction activities, and improper drainage. Teacher explains types of erosion and their features.

**Step 4 – Application:** Groups examine soil samples and charts to match control measures (terracing, planting cover crops, building drainage channels, mulching, planting trees) with specific erosion problems.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to define erosion, state causes, and describe control measures.

### Content Summary

1. **Soil erosion** is the removal of the topsoil by **water**, **wind**, or **human activities**.
2. Causes include **heavy rainfall**, **deforestation**, **overgrazing**, **bush burning**, **poor farming**, and **bad drainage systems**.
3. Types of erosion include **sheet erosion** (thin layers), **rill erosion** (small channels), and **gully erosion** (deep channels).
4. Control methods involve **planting trees**, **cover cropping**, **terracing**, **mulching**, **constructing drainage channels**, and **avoiding overgrazing**.

### Conclusion

Teacher reminds students that preventing erosion protects soil fertility, roads, and buildings.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Soil erosion happens when **topsoil is washed or blown away**.
- Human actions like **cutting trees** and **bad farming** increase erosion.
- Erosion types are **sheet**, **rill**, and **gully**.
- Control erosion by **planting vegetation**, **building terraces and drains**, and **handling land carefully**.
- Planting **trees and cover crops** holds soil with roots, while mulching protects the ground from direct rainfall impact.
- Communities can **work together to clear blocked drainage and avoid bush burning**, which keeps the soil safe and fertile.

### Assignment

Design a poster advising your community on three ways to prevent soil erosion and explain one benefit of each method.
