### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays assorted food items and asks pupils to identify the food groups each belongs to.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines a balanced diet as a meal containing all food nutrients in the right quantities for the body.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses each nutrient class (carbohydrates, proteins, fats and oils, vitamins, minerals, water) and explains how balanced diets support growth, energy, disease resistance, and proper body functions.

**Step 4 – Application:** In groups, pupils arrange given food cards to form balanced meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, then present reasons for their selections.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks pupils to define balanced diet, list nutrient classes, and state the importance of eating balanced meals.

### Content Summary

1. A **balanced diet** contains all food nutrients—**carbohydrates**, **proteins**, **fats and oils**, **vitamins**, **minerals**, and **water**—in the right amounts.
2. Balanced diets provide **energy**, **support growth and repair**, **protect against diseases**, and **help the body work properly**.
3. Examples of balanced meals include combinations such as **rice and beans with vegetables**, **yam with egg sauce and fruit**, and **pap with milk and groundnuts**.
4. Families plan balanced meals by **including different food groups**, **using local ingredients**, and **avoiding excess sugar and fatty foods**.

### Conclusion

Teacher reminds pupils that healthy families choose meals that supply all nutrients for body health.

### Student Lesson Notes

- A **balanced diet** contains all the classes of food in the correct amounts.
- The classes are **carbohydrates**, **proteins**, **fats and oils**, **vitamins**, **minerals**, and **water**.
- Balanced meals help the body **grow**, **stay strong**, and **fight diseases**.
- Families can combine local foods like **beans, vegetables, fish, fruits, grains, and water** to make balanced diets daily.

### Assignment

Write out a one-day family menu that shows breakfast, lunch, and dinner as balanced meals. State the nutrient class each meal provides.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 1st October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Living Things – Common Characteristics
- **Subtopic:** Characteristics of Organisms in the Same Habitat and What They Have in Common
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; Illustrated Ecology Textbook; Field Guide on Nigerian Habitats
- **Instructional Materials:** Habitat charts (pond, forest, savannah); organism picture cards; magnifying glasses; comparison worksheets
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students are already familiar with the concept of habitats and can name examples of organisms in their environment.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Identify at least three habitats and the organisms found there.
  2. Describe four characteristics organisms share within the same habitat.
  3. Explain how shared characteristics help organisms survive together.
  4. Compare two habitats by listing similarities and differences among their organisms.
  5. Present findings from group investigations on habitat adaptations.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays habitat charts and asks students to match organisms to their natural environments.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews the meaning of a habitat as the natural home where organisms obtain food, water, shelter, and mates.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher highlights common characteristics such as body coverings, feeding patterns, breathing organs, locomotion methods, and behavioural habits shared by organisms in the same habitat.

**Step 4 – Application:** Groups analyse assigned habitat cards, list four organisms in the habitat, and record the shared features that help them survive; groups present their findings.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on habitat definitions, shared characteristics, and survival advantages.

### Content Summary

1. A **habitat** is the natural environment of an organism.
2. Organisms in the same habitat share features like **body coverings** (scales, fur, feathers), **feeding styles**, **breathing organs**, and **behavioural patterns** suited to the habitat.
3. Shared characteristics help organisms **obtain food**, **avoid predators**, **reproduce**, and **cope with climate**.
4. Comparing habitats shows that different environments demand different adaptations.

### Conclusion

Teacher emphasises that similar conditions in a habitat lead to similar features among the organisms living there.

### Student Lesson Notes

- A **habitat** provides organisms with food, water, air, shelter, and space.
- Organisms living together may share **body coverings**, **ways of feeding**, **movement styles**, and **behavioural habits**.
- These shared features help them **survive** and **raise their young** successfully.
- When a habitat changes, organisms may **adapt, migrate, or die** if they cannot cope.

### Assignment

Choose one habitat near your home, list four organisms that live there, and describe one shared characteristic that helps them survive in that habitat.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Thursday, 2nd October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 3
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Third
- **Topic:** Family Traits
- **Subtopic:** Importance of Family Traits and Genealogy
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 3; Junior Secondary Genetics Workbook; Family History Charts
- **Instructional Materials:** Family trait charts, sample pedigree diagrams, photographs showing inherited features, blank genealogy templates
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have observed similarities among family members such as facial features, height, or talents.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Define family traits and give examples within their families.
  2. State at least four reasons why family traits are important.
  3. Explain the concept of genealogy and how family histories are traced.
  4. Draw a simple family tree showing inherited traits across three generations.
  5. Analyse how knowledge of family traits can guide health and career decisions.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows pictures of family members with similar traits and asks students to identify the features they share.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines family traits as characteristics passed from parents to children through genes.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses the importance of family traits in identifying relatives, predicting inherited abilities or health risks, fostering family unity, and maintaining cultural identity. Teacher introduces genealogy as the study of family history using records and family trees.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in pairs to fill in a genealogy template for an imaginary family, noting traits such as eye colour, blood group, or talents across generations.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to list examples of family traits, explain why they matter, and describe how genealogy helps families.

### Content Summary

1. **Family traits** are inherited features like **facial shape**, **blood group**, **height**, or **talents** passed from parents to children.
2. Importance of family traits includes **recognising family members**, **planning healthcare**, **preserving family identity**, and **discovering talents**.
3. **Genealogy** is the study of family history using records, interviews, and family trees to trace traits through generations.
4. Family trees or pedigree charts help families track **traits**, **health conditions**, and **relationships** over time.

### Conclusion

Teacher concludes that understanding family traits and genealogy helps individuals appreciate their heritage and make informed choices.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Family traits** are qualities passed down through genes from parents to children.
- They help families **identify one another**, **predict health issues**, and **understand talents**.
- **Genealogy** is the record of family history shown through **family trees** or **pedigree charts**.
- Keeping family records helps preserve **culture**, **values**, and **medical information** for future generations.

### Assignment

Interview your parents or guardians to list five family traits you share with relatives. Draw a simple family tree showing how two of these traits appear across three generations.
