  3. List the six main components of a balanced diet with local examples.
  4. Group sample foods under their correct nutrient classes during class activity.
  5. Explain briefly how an unbalanced diet affects family health.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays pictures of different family meals and asks pupils to identify the foods and say whether the meals look complete or incomplete.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines a balanced diet as a meal that contains the right amounts of all food nutrient classes needed by the body daily.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses the components of a balanced diet – carbohydrates, proteins, fats and oils, vitamins, minerals, and water – and highlights examples of local foods that supply each nutrient.

**Step 4 – Application:** Pupils, in groups, arrange sample foods or pictures under the correct nutrient headings and explain why each item belongs there.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks pupils to define a balanced diet, mention four importance of balanced diets, and list the six components.

### Content Summary

1. A **balanced diet** is a meal that contains the right quantities of all the six classes of food nutrients.
2. Components of a balanced diet are **carbohydrates**, **proteins**, **fats and oils**, **vitamins**, **minerals**, and **water**.
3. Importance of balanced diets: **support growth**, **provide energy**, **build and repair tissues**, **protect against diseases**, and **help the body work properly**.
4. Unbalanced diets can cause **malnutrition**, **weakness**, **slow growth**, and **illnesses** in family members.

### Conclusion

Teacher emphasises that healthy families plan meals to include all nutrient classes each day.

### Student Lesson Notes

- A **balanced diet** means eating the right amounts of every nutrient class each day.
- The nutrient classes are **carbohydrates, proteins, fats and oils, vitamins, minerals, and water**.
- Balanced diets keep us **strong**, **active**, **free from disease**, and **able to grow well**.
- When we skip nutrient classes often, the family may suffer from **malnutrition** or frequent sickness.

### Assignment

Write out two examples of balanced meals you can eat in one day and state the main nutrients each meal supplies.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 1st October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Living Things – Habitat Relationships
- **Subtopic:** Characteristics Organisms Share Within the Same Habitat
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; STAN Basic Science Book 2; Illustrated Guide to Ecosystems
- **Instructional Materials:** Charts of forest, aquatic, and grassland habitats; video clips of organisms in their homes; specimens or models of local plants and animals
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students know that living things need food, shelter, and water to survive.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. State what a habitat is and give examples.
  2. Describe three characteristics organisms living in the same habitat often share.
  3. Explain why organisms in the same habitat may have similar needs and behaviours.
  4. Compare organisms from different habitats and point out similarities and differences.
  5. Discuss how shared characteristics promote survival within a habitat.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays habitat charts and asks students to identify organisms living in each habitat.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews the meaning of habitat as the natural home of an organism and lists examples such as forest, river, desert, and savannah.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains that organisms sharing a habitat often have common characteristics like similar body coverings, feeding styles, reproductive patterns, and responses to environmental conditions.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups to analyse habitat cards; they list at least three characteristics organisms in that habitat have in common and present findings to the class.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to describe characteristics organisms share in the same habitat and why these characteristics are important.

### Content Summary

1. A **habitat** is where an organism naturally lives and obtains its food, water, shelter, and mates.
2. Organisms in the same habitat share characteristics such as **similar body structures** (e.g., fish with fins), **feeding patterns** (e.g., grazing animals in grasslands), and **behavioural responses** (e.g., nocturnal animals in deserts).
3. Shared characteristics help organisms to **survive**, **reproduce**, and **avoid predators** within their environment.
4. Differences in habitats result in different adaptations; comparing habitats shows why organisms look and behave differently.

### Conclusion

Teacher highlights that a habitat shapes the features and behaviours organisms have in common.

### Student Lesson Notes

- A **habitat** is the natural home of a living thing.
- Organisms in the same habitat often have **similar body coverings**, **ways of getting food**, and **behaviours** that suit the environment.
- These common characteristics help them **survive the weather**, **find food**, and **raise their young** successfully.
- When the habitat changes, organisms may need to adjust or move to survive.

### Assignment

Choose any habitat around you and describe three organisms that live there, mentioning one characteristic they share that helps them survive.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Friday, 3rd October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 3
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Third
- **Topic:** Family Traits – Genealogy
- **Subtopic:** Importance of Family Traits and Tracing Family Lineage
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 3; Genetics for Junior Secondary Schools; Family Health Education Texts
- **Instructional Materials:** Family tree chart, photographs of family members, trait survey worksheets, video clip on heredity
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students know that children often resemble their parents or relatives.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Explain the meaning of family traits and genealogy.
  2. State at least four importance of recognising family traits.
  3. Draw a simple family tree showing traits passed down generations.
  4. Discuss how knowledge of family traits aids health and personal decisions.
  5. Appreciate the role of genealogy in preserving family history and culture.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows a sample family tree and asks students to identify common physical traits among family members.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines family traits as inherited features passed from parents to children and explains genealogy as the study of family lineage.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses the importance of family traits in understanding heredity, detecting hereditary diseases, preserving cultural identity, and strengthening family bonds.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students use trait survey worksheets to record traits in their families and sketch a simple family tree indicating how traits appear across generations.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to mention the importance of family traits and describe how genealogy helps families.

### Content Summary

1. **Family traits** are inherited features such as eye colour, blood group, dimples, or talents passed from parents to children.
2. **Genealogy** is the study of family history and how different generations are linked.
3. Importance of knowing family traits includes **predicting hereditary conditions**, **planning for personal health**, **preserving culture**, and **strengthening family identity**.
4. Drawing a **family tree** helps record how traits and relationships pass from one generation to another.

### Conclusion

Teacher encourages students to discuss family traits with parents and keep records of their family histories.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Family traits are features we inherit from our parents and grandparents.
- Studying **genealogy** helps us trace our family roots and understand how traits are passed down.
- Knowing family traits is important for **health planning**, **cultural preservation**, **identity**, and **family unity**.
- Family trees are charts that show who is related and how traits move through generations.

### Assignment

Interview family members to identify five traits that run in your family. Draw a simple family tree showing how two of the traits have been passed down.
