  3. Mention five harmful effects of drug abuse on individuals and families.
  4. Suggest practical ways pupils can avoid drug abuse in their environment.
  5. Demonstrate refusal skills through role-play scenarios about peer pressure.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays pictures of medicines and illegal substances, asking pupils to explain the difference between using drugs properly and abusing them.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines a drug as any substance that changes how the body works and explains drug abuse as using drugs without medical advice, taking wrong doses, or using banned substances.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses examples of abused drugs (codeine syrups, tramadol, inhalants, cannabis) and explains effects such as addiction, poor school performance, damaged organs, violence, and family breakdown.

**Step 4 – Application:** In groups, pupils role-play peer-pressure situations and practise saying “no” using refusal skills and support from trusted adults.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks pupils to define drug abuse, list examples of abused drugs, and state effects on individuals and families.

### Content Summary

1. A **drug** is any substance that alters how the body works; **drug abuse** means using drugs wrongly or taking illegal substances.
2. Examples of commonly abused drugs include **codeine cough syrups**, **tramadol**, **glue or inhalants**, and **cannabis**.
3. Effects of drug abuse: **addiction**, **brain and liver damage**, **poor academic performance**, **violence**, and **broken family relationships**.
4. Pupils can avoid drug abuse by **following medical instructions**, **staying away from bad company**, **seeking help from trusted adults**, and **joining healthy school clubs**.

### Conclusion

Teacher emphasises that a healthy family guides children to use medicines properly and stay away from harmful substances.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Drug abuse** is the wrong or excessive use of drugs and substances that harm the body.
- Abused drugs include **codeine mixtures**, **tramadol tablets**, **glue**, and **cannabis**.
- Effects include **addiction**, **weak body organs**, **poor behaviour**, and **family problems**.
- We should **obey doctors’ instructions**, **avoid bad influence**, and **speak up for help** to prevent drug abuse.

### Assignment

Write five effects of drug abuse on teenagers and suggest one way each effect can be prevented.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 1st October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Living Things – Common Features
- **Subtopic:** Characteristics Organisms Share in the Same Habitat
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; Illustrated Ecology Textbook; Field Study Guide on Habitats
- **Instructional Materials:** Habitat charts (pond, forest, desert), specimen models or pictures, magnifying glasses, comparison worksheets
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can already list some living and non-living things found around their school environment.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Define a habitat and give at least three examples.
  2. Describe four characteristics organisms in the same habitat share.
  3. Explain why similar adaptations help organisms survive together.
  4. Compare two habitats and state similarities and differences among their organisms.
  5. Summarise findings from a group investigation about habitat adaptations.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows habitat charts and asks students to identify the organisms found in each scene.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews the meaning of a habitat as the natural home where an organism finds food, shelter, water, and mates.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains shared characteristics such as body coverings (scales, fur), feeding styles (grazing, filter feeding), breathing methods, and behavioural patterns suited to the habitat.

**Step 4 – Application:** Groups select a habitat card, list four organisms there, and record the common features that help each survive; groups present findings to the class.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to describe shared features of organisms in one habitat and explain how the features aid survival.

### Content Summary

1. A **habitat** is the natural home of an organism where it gets all it needs to live.
2. Organisms in the same habitat share features like **body coverings**, **feeding patterns**, **breathing organs**, and **behavioural routines**.
3. These common characteristics help organisms **survive**, **reproduce**, and **avoid danger** within their environment.
4. Comparing habitats shows that different environments produce different adaptations.

### Conclusion

Teacher highlights that habitats shape the structure and behaviour of organisms living together.

### Student Lesson Notes

- A **habitat** is where an organism naturally lives and finds its needs.
- Organisms in the same habitat often have similar **body coverings**, **ways of feeding**, and **behaviours**.
- Shared characteristics help them **cope with weather**, **find food**, and **raise their young**.
- When a habitat changes, organisms must **adapt, migrate, or may die** if they cannot cope.

### Assignment

Choose a habitat near your community and list four organisms found there, stating one common feature they share that suits the habitat.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Thursday, 2nd October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 3
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Third
- **Topic:** Environmental Hazards (I) – Erosion
- **Subtopic:** Definition, Causes, and Control of Soil Erosion
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 3; Environmental Management Textbook; Ministry of Environment Pamphlets on Soil Conservation
- **Instructional Materials:** Pictures of eroded land, soil samples, charts showing erosion control methods, short documentary clip on erosion
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have seen gullies or washed-out areas after heavy rainfall in their communities.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Define erosion accurately.
  2. Identify at least five causes of soil erosion in their locality.
  3. Describe different types of soil erosion with examples.
  4. Suggest practical methods of controlling soil erosion at home and in school.
  5. Evaluate the effectiveness of erosion control measures used in case studies.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays photographs of eroded farmlands and roads, asking students what they notice and how erosion affects people.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines soil erosion as the removal and washing away of the topsoil by agents like water, wind, or human activities.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses causes including heavy rainfall, deforestation, overgrazing, poor farming methods, construction without drainage, and natural slope of the land.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students analyse case studies of eroded sites, identify causes, and propose control measures such as planting cover crops, building terraces, constructing drainage channels, and practising contour ploughing.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to define erosion, state causes, and list control measures for local environments.

### Content Summary

1. **Soil erosion** is the wearing away and movement of topsoil by water, wind, or human actions.
2. Causes include **heavy rainfall**, **deforestation**, **overgrazing**, **poor farming practices**, **construction without drainage**, and **natural slopes**.
3. Types of erosion include **sheet erosion**, **rill erosion**, and **gully erosion**; each removes soil in different ways.
4. Control measures: **plant cover crops and trees**, **build terraces**, **construct drainage systems**, **use contour ridges**, and **avoid bush burning**.

### Conclusion

Teacher stresses that protecting the soil prevents loss of farmland, road damage, and environmental disasters.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Erosion** means the removal of topsoil by water, wind, or human activities.
- It is caused by **heavy rainfall**, **tree removal**, **overgrazing**, **poor farming**, and **bad construction practices**.
- Types of erosion include **sheet**, **rill**, and **gully erosion**.
- We control erosion by **planting vegetation**, **building terraces or drains**, and **managing land properly**.

### Assignment

Investigate an eroded area around your community and write a short report describing the type of erosion, its causes, and two control measures that can be applied.
