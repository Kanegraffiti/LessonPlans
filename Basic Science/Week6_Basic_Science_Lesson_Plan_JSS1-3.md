### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays images of polluted and unpolluted environments and asks pupils to share how pollution affects daily life.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines environmental pollution and differentiates among air, soil, and water pollution with real-life examples.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses the effects of pollution on health, crops, animals, climate, and infrastructure, highlighting issues such as respiratory diseases, reduced soil fertility, and contaminated water sources.

**Step 4 – Application:** In groups, pupils list ways to reduce pollution (e.g., planting trees, proper waste disposal, using cleaner fuels) and match them to pollution control measures like recycling programmes, emission standards, and sanitation laws.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks pupils to name types of pollution, outline their effects, and describe specific actions individuals and government agencies can take to control pollution.

### Content Summary

1. **Environmental pollution** is the contamination of air, soil, or water by harmful substances or energy.
2. Air pollution leads to **breathing problems**, **acid rain**, and **climate change**; soil pollution causes **poor crop yield** and **soil infertility**; water pollution results in **water-borne diseases** and **death of aquatic life**.
3. Ways to reduce pollution include **proper waste disposal**, **using dustbins**, **planting trees**, **maintaining vehicles**, and **avoiding bush burning**.
4. Pollution control measures involve **enforcing environmental laws**, **setting emission limits**, **treating industrial waste**, and **organising community sanitation exercises**.

### Conclusion

Teacher emphasises that everyone shares the responsibility of keeping the environment free from pollution to protect health and natural resources.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Environmental pollution occurs when harmful materials enter the **air, soil, or water**.
- Pollution causes **diseases**, **poor crop growth**, **dirty water**, and **damage to living things and property**.
- We reduce pollution by **proper waste disposal**, **recycling**, **planting trees**, **maintaining vehicles**, and **avoiding open burning**.
- Pollution control measures include **environmental laws**, **emission testing**, **wastewater treatment**, and **community clean-up programmes**.

### Assignment

Draw and label a poster encouraging your community to reduce pollution. Include three effects of pollution and three control measures on your poster.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 22nd October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Living Things
- **Subtopic:** Application of Basic Intelligence Skills
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; Science Process Skills Handbook; Observation and Recording Worksheets
- **Instructional Materials:** Specimens of leaves, shells, and insects (real or models), magnifying glasses, classification charts, puzzle cards, recording sheets
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students already know the characteristics of living things and have practised simple observation and classification activities.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. List the basic intelligence skills used in studying living things.
  2. Demonstrate accurate observation and comparison skills using provided specimens.
  3. Record data in a neatly organised table showing similarities and differences among living things.
  4. Use deductive reasoning to group specimens based on observable features.
  5. Present findings that explain how intelligence skills support scientific investigations of living things.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays different specimens and asks students how scientists study living things carefully.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews intelligence skills such as observation, classification, measurement, prediction, inference, and communication.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher demonstrates how to apply these skills by comparing two leaves and noting colour, size, texture, and venation, leading students to draw conclusions about plant types.

**Step 4 – Application:** In groups, students examine assigned specimens, observe features, measure lengths, classify them, and record findings in tables before making inferences about their habitats or adaptations.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks groups to present their tables, state the intelligence skills used, and explain how the skills helped them understand the specimens.

### Content Summary

1. Basic intelligence skills include **observation**, **classification**, **measurement**, **prediction**, **inference**, and **communication**.
2. These skills help scientists **collect accurate data**, **organise information**, and **draw conclusions** about living things.
3. Applying intelligence skills involves **careful observation**, **recording data**, **grouping similar features**, and **explaining findings clearly**.

### Conclusion

Teacher reinforces that using intelligence skills makes the study of living things accurate, enjoyable, and meaningful.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Scientists study living things by using **observation**, **classification**, **measurement**, **prediction**, **inference**, and **communication** skills.
- Careful observation and recording help us **notice similarities and differences** among organisms.
- Classification and reasoning lead to **better understanding of habitats and adaptations**.
- Sharing findings through tables and presentations is part of **communicating scientific results**.

### Assignment

Create a two-column table showing five intelligence skills and explain one way each skill helps scientists study living things.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 3

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows pictures and video clips of bush fires and asks students to describe what they observe and how the fires might have started.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines bush burning and highlights practices such as land clearing with fire, hunting, charcoal production, careless disposal of cigarettes, and burning refuse in the dry season.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses the effects of bush burning including loss of soil fertility, destruction of wildlife habitat, air pollution, property damage, and health issues like smoke inhalation.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups to analyse case studies of local bush fires, list contributing factors, match them to relevant regulations (e.g., bush burning permits, fire bans), and suggest preventive actions.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher questions students on definitions, practices that influence bush burning, effects, and specific regulations or community actions to control it.

### Content Summary

1. **Bush burning** is the deliberate or accidental setting of vegetation on fire for purposes like land clearing, hunting, or waste disposal.
2. Practices that influence bush burning include **dry-season farming**, **careless use of fire by hunters**, **charcoal production**, **smoking in the bush**, and **burning refuse**.
