- **Sanitation** means keeping our homes, classrooms, and surroundings clean so that germs cannot grow.
- A **germ** is a tiny living thing that causes sickness; cleaning and washing stop germs from spreading.
- We clean to **prevent diseases**, make places **comfortable to live in**, and keep everyone **safe and healthy**.
- Common sanitation methods include **sweeping floors**, **mopping with clean water**, **washing hands with soap**, **packing refuse into covered bins**, and **clearing gutters or drains** so water can flow freely.
- Keeping **gutters and drains clear** stops stagnant water from collecting and prevents mosquitoes and other pests from spreading diseases like malaria.
- Practise sanitation every day by **wiping surfaces, washing clothes and dishes regularly, storing food properly**, and reminding family members to clean shared spaces.


- Create a study box in your notebook for **Sanitation** with clear definitions, labelled sketches, and two everyday examples so you can explain it without looking at the textbook.
- Add a short checklist that reminds you how to apply **Sanitation** in class activities, projects, or safety routines, noting common mistakes to avoid.

3. Adaptations help living things survive, e.g. giraffe long neck for browsing, fish gills for breathing in water.

### Conclusion

Teacher reviews main ideas on habitats and adaptations and urges students to observe living things around their environments.

### Student Lesson Notes

- A **habitat** is the natural home of a plant or animal where it finds food, water, air, and shelter.
- Examples of habitats are **forest** (many trees and animals), **desert** (hot, dry land with little water), **freshwater** (rivers and ponds), **marine** (seas and oceans), and **arboreal** (tree tops where animals like monkeys live).
- An **adaptation** is a special body part or behaviour that helps a living thing survive in its habitat, such as **camel humps storing fat**, **duck webbed feet for swimming**, **cactus spines reducing water loss**, or **fish gills for breathing in water**.
- Living things must match their adaptations to the right habitat so that they can get what they need and stay alive.
- When habitats change, organisms may **migrate, adapt further, or risk dying out**, so protecting habitats keeps living things safe.
- Draw a table in your notebook listing **organism, habitat, and adaptation** to help you remember how each example survives.


- Create a study box in your notebook for **habitat** with clear definitions, labelled sketches, and two everyday examples so you can explain it without looking at the textbook.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher defines dominant traits as those that appear more frequently and recessive traits as those hidden unless paired together, giving examples like free earlobes (dominant) and attached earlobes (recessive).

**Step 4 – Application:** Students examine themselves using mirrors, record their traits, and classify them as dominant or recessive in groups.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to differentiate between dominant and recessive traits and provide personal examples.

### Content Summary

1. Family traits are inherited characteristics passed from parents to children.
2. Dominant traits show up when present in one parent, e.g. dimples, rolling tongue.
3. Recessive traits appear only when inherited from both parents, e.g. attached earlobes, straight hairline.

### Conclusion

Teacher summarises the meaning of family traits, dominant traits, and recessive traits, encouraging students to discuss their findings with their families.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Family traits** are physical or behavioural features passed from parents to children, such as eye colour or dimples.
- A **dominant trait** is a strong trait that shows even if it comes from only one parent. Examples: free earlobes, the ability to roll the tongue, dimples.
- A **recessive trait** is a hidden trait that shows only when it is received from both parents. Examples: attached earlobes, straight hairline, inability to roll the tongue.
- **Genes** are tiny instructions inside cells that carry traits from parents to children and decide whether a trait is dominant or recessive.
- Members of the same family can look alike or different because they receive different combinations of genes from their parents.
- Keep a **simple family trait chart** where you record relatives who show dominant or recessive traits to see patterns more clearly.
- Remember that **environmental factors** like nutrition and exercise can influence how traits appear, even when genes stay the same.


- Create a study box in your notebook for **Family traits** with clear definitions, labelled sketches, and two everyday examples so you can explain it without looking at the textbook.
- Add a short checklist that reminds you how to apply **Family traits** in class activities, projects, or safety routines, noting common mistakes to avoid.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups with habitat charts to match organisms with adaptive features and explain how each feature supports survival.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher conducts oral questioning on the meaning of adaptation, examples from different habitats, and the importance of adaptations.

### Content Summary

1. An **adaptation** is a special body part or behaviour that helps an organism survive in its habitat.
2. Examples: **camels** store fat in humps and have long eyelashes to protect against sand; **ducks** have webbed feet for swimming; **cacti** have thick stems to store water; **mangrove plants** have prop roots for support.
3. Adaptations help organisms to **obtain food**, **escape predators**, **conserve water**, and **cope with environmental conditions**.
4. When habitats change, organisms may migrate, adapt further, or risk extinction.

### Conclusion

Teacher summarises key adaptations discussed and encourages students to observe how plants and animals around them survive in their habitats.

### Student Lesson Notes

- An **adaptation** is a special way a plant or animal is built or behaves that helps it live in its home.
- Examples: **Camels** have humps to store fat and long eyelashes to keep out sand; **ducks** have webbed feet for swimming; **fish** have gills to breathe in water; **cacti** have spines that reduce water loss.
- Adaptations allow living things to get food, stay safe, and cope with heat, cold, or water.
- If the habitat changes too much, living things must move, adapt more, or they may die.
- Some adaptations are **behavioural**, like birds migrating when seasons change, while others are **structural**, like thick fur for warmth.
- Sketch or label pictures of organisms showing their adaptations to remember how each feature helps them survive.


- Create a study box in your notebook for **adaptation** with clear definitions, labelled sketches, and two everyday examples so you can explain it without looking at the textbook.
- Add a short checklist that reminds you how to apply **adaptation** in class activities, projects, or safety routines, noting common mistakes to avoid.

  3. Identify dominant and recessive traits from family trait charts.
  4. Use simple Punnett square examples to show inheritance of dominant and recessive traits.
  5. Record their own observable traits and classify them as dominant or recessive.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher asks students to compare eye colour, earlobe type, and dimples among classmates and note similarities.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines dominant traits as strong traits that show when present and recessive traits as hidden traits that appear only when inherited from both parents.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher uses Punnett square examples to show how dominant (e.g. D) and recessive (e.g. d) genes combine to produce traits; demonstrates with traits such as dimples (dominant) and no dimples (recessive).

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups to complete simple Punnett squares and classify classroom traits as dominant or recessive.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher assesses students through oral questions on definitions, examples, and Punnett square outcomes.

### Content Summary

1. **Dominant traits** are strong traits that show in an offspring even if only one parent passes them on.
2. **Recessive traits** are hidden traits that appear only when inherited from both parents.
3. When a dominant gene is paired with a recessive gene, the dominant trait masks the recessive one.
4. Punnett squares help us predict how traits are inherited from parents to children.

### Conclusion

Teacher recaps the meaning of dominant and recessive traits and encourages students to discuss family traits with parents to understand inheritance better.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Dominant traits** (like dimples, free earlobes, rolling tongue) show easily because the dominant gene is strong.
- **Recessive traits** (like attached earlobes, straight hairline, inability to roll the tongue) appear only when both parents pass the recessive gene.
- A dominant gene written with a capital letter hides a recessive gene written with a small letter when they are together.
- Using simple **Punnett squares** helps us see the chances of children inheriting certain traits from their parents.
- When reading family charts, note that **dominant traits do not disappear**; they may skip appearing if paired with another dominant gene but can reappear in later generations.
- Observe members of your family and record which traits are dominant or recessive to practise explaining inheritance in real life.


- Create a study box in your notebook for **Dominant traits** with clear definitions, labelled sketches, and two everyday examples so you can explain it without looking at the textbook.
- Add a short checklist that reminds you how to apply **Dominant traits** in class activities, projects, or safety routines, noting common mistakes to avoid.

### Assignment
