Lesson Content:
Mechanical Energy Transmission
- Transfer of motion/power from one part of a machine to another.

Types
- Belt drive: uses belt and pulleys.
- Chain drive: uses chain and sprockets.
- Gear drive: uses meshing gears.
- Friction drive: uses contact between rotating surfaces.

Uses
- Bicycle movement.
- Industrial machines.
- Vehicle and workshop systems.

Safety Precautions
- Keep guards in place.
- Avoid loose clothing around moving parts.
- Lubricate and maintain systems regularly.
Evaluation:

Duration: 40 minutes
Period: 2nd Period
Subject: Basic Technology
Topic: Mechanical Energy Transmission System
Subtopic: Belt and chain drives (construction, advantages, and limitations)
Reference Materials:
- NERDC Basic Technology Curriculum for Upper Basic Education (JSS3)
- State Scheme of Work for Second Term Basic Technology
- Approved Basic Technology textbooks for Junior Secondary Schools
Instructional Materials:
- Real bicycle chain and sprocket
- Belt and pulley samples
- Diagram chart for labelled components
- Whiteboard and marker
Previous Knowledge:
- Learners can define mechanical transmission and list its types.
Entry Behaviour:
- Learners can identify belt and chain on common machines.
Behavioural Objectives:
By the end of the lesson, learners should be able to:
- describe parts of belt drive and chain drive.
- differentiate belt drive from chain drive.
- state at least three advantages of each system.
- identify limitations of each system.
- recommend suitable system for given applications.
Lesson Presentations:
Step 1: Introduction/Set Induction
- Teacher recaps Contact 1 and displays belt and chain samples.
- Learners observe and state visible differences.
Step 2: Presentation/Teaching Steps
- Teacher explains components of belt drive: driver pulley, driven pulley, belt.
- Teacher explains components of chain drive: chain, driver sprocket, driven sprocket.
- Teacher discusses advantages and disadvantages of both systems.
- Teacher presents practical examples and selection considerations.
Step 3: Learners’ Activities
- Learners label diagrams in groups.
- Learners complete comparison table.
- Learners respond to application questions.
Step 4: Summary/Board Summary
- Components of belt and chain drives.
- Advantages and limitations.
- Selection for use.
Lesson Content:
Belt Drive
- Components: belt, driver pulley, driven pulley.
- Advantages: smooth operation, simple design, low cost.
- Limitations: slipping may occur; less suitable for very heavy loads.

Chain Drive
- Components: chain, driver sprocket, driven sprocket.
- Advantages: positive drive with little slip; suitable for heavy loads.
- Limitations: noisier, requires lubrication and maintenance.

Comparison
- Belt drive is quieter; chain drive is stronger and more reliable for high load.
Evaluation:
1. List the parts of a belt drive.
2. List the parts of a chain drive.
3. State two advantages of belt drive.
4. State two limitations of chain drive.
5. Differentiate belt drive from chain drive.
6. Which system is better for heavy load and why?
7. Draw and label one transmission system of your choice.
Conclusion:
- Teacher emphasizes proper understanding of transmission systems for safe machine operation and maintenance.
Assignment:
1. Write and explain differences between belt drive and chain drive.
2. Draw and label belt drive and chain drive systems.
3. Suggest a suitable transmission system for bicycle, generator, and factory conveyor with reasons.
