### Student Lesson Notes

- Early humans counted with **fingers, stones, and sticks** before making special tools.
- **Tally sticks** were marked pieces of wood used to keep scores or records.
- The **abacus** is a frame with beads used for counting and performing simple arithmetic.
- **Napier's bones** were rods with multiplication tables that made calculation faster.
- These early devices were the foundation for the computers we use today.

### Assignment

Draw any two early counting devices and state what they were used for.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Computer Software
- **Subtopic:** Introduction and Definition of Software
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Basic Science and Technology for JSS 2; NERDC Information Technology for Junior Secondary Schools; Computer Studies Textbook for JSS 2
- **Instructional Materials:** Computer system, projector slides showing software types, flash cards with software names
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have used school computers for typing and educational games.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Define software correctly.
  2. Differentiate between hardware and software with examples.
  3. Identify system software and application software.
  4. Mention examples of common software used in school and at home.
  5. Explain the importance of software in operating the computer.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher shows a computer system and asks students to name the physical parts they can see and the programs they use on it.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines software as the set of instructions or programs that tell the hardware what to do.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher distinguishes between system software (operating system, utility programs) and application software (word processors, games, browsers) using examples.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups to sort software names on flash cards into system software and application software, explaining their choices.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks oral questions on the definition of software, differences between hardware and software, and examples of each type of software.

### Content Summary

1. **Software** is a collection of programs or instructions that tell the computer how to perform tasks.
2. Computer system is made up of **hardware** (physical parts) and **software** (programs and data).
3. **System software** controls the hardware and includes the operating system (Windows, Linux), utilities (antivirus, backup tools), and language translators.
4. **Application software** helps users perform specific tasks like writing (Microsoft Word), drawing (Paint), browsing (Chrome), or learning (educational apps).

### Conclusion

Teacher restates that computers cannot work without software and encourages students to note the software they use daily.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Software** is the invisible part of the computer that tells the hardware what to do.
- Two main types of software are **system software** and **application software**.
- System software includes **operating systems** (Windows, Linux, Android) and **utility programs** (antivirus, disk cleanup).
- Application software includes **word processors**, **spreadsheets**, **games**, **web browsers**, and **media players**.
- Hardware is the body of the computer, while software is the mind that gives instructions.

### Assignment
