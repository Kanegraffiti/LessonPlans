DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 22nd October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Units of Storage in Computers
- **Subtopic:** Units of Storage
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Information Technology for JSS 2; Digital Literacy Handbook; Data Storage Conversion Chart
- **Instructional Materials:** Storage unit flashcards, capacity comparison table, memory sticks of different sizes, conversion worksheet
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can identify bits and bytes from previous lessons and have used storage devices like flash drives and memory cards.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Define data storage units from bit to terabyte.
  2. State the relationship between bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes.
  3. Convert data sizes between at least two different storage units accurately.
  4. Match common digital files to appropriate storage units based on size.
  5. Prepare a conversion table showing equivalent values across storage units.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays storage devices with labelled capacities and asks students how data size is measured.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews basic definitions of bit and byte, then introduces larger units (KB, MB, GB, TB).

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher demonstrates conversions (e.g., 1 byte = 8 bits, 1 KB = 1024 bytes) and explains how file types relate to storage capacity.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students use flashcards and worksheets to practise converting data sizes and matching files to storage units (e.g., text document, song, video).

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher gives quick oral quizzes and checks conversion tables for accuracy.

### Content Summary

1. Storage units include **bit**, **byte**, **kilobyte (KB)**, **megabyte (MB)**, **gigabyte (GB)**, and **terabyte (TB)**.
2. Relationships: **8 bits = 1 byte**, **1024 bytes = 1 KB**, **1024 KB = 1 MB**, **1024 MB = 1 GB**, **1024 GB = 1 TB**.
3. Knowing units helps users **estimate file sizes**, **choose storage devices**, and **manage data effectively**.

### Conclusion

Teacher explains that understanding storage units supports efficient computer usage and prevents data loss.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Data is measured using **bits and bytes** and larger units like **KB, MB, GB, and TB**.
- **8 bits make 1 byte**, and each higher unit is **1024 times** the previous one.
- Understanding units helps us **select the right storage device** and **manage files wisely**.
- Create a quick summary in your notebook highlighting the key terms, diagrams, and examples from this lesson.
- Teach a friend or family member what you learned to check your understanding and build confidence.


### Assignment

Complete a conversion table converting the following: 2048 KB to MB, 3 GB to MB, 5120 MB to GB, and 2.5 TB to GB.
