- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Information Technology for JSS 2; Computer Studies Workbook; Base Conversion Chart
- **Instructional Materials:** Place-value charts for bases 2, 8, 10, and 16; flashcards with digits; worksheets for conversion exercises; projector for demonstration
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can count in base ten and have seen binary digits during introductory lessons.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Define a number system and identify bases used in computing.
  2. Distinguish between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems.
  3. Convert numbers from decimal to binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
  4. Convert numbers from binary to decimal using place values.
  5. Solve simple word problems that require base conversions.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays digits 0–9 and letters A–F and asks students why computers use different symbols for counting.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines a number system as a method of representing numbers using a base and symbols.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains the bases 2, 8, 10, and 16, showing place values and how to read numbers in each system. Teacher demonstrates conversions step by step.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in pairs to complete conversion worksheets, converting between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher gives quick oral questions on conversions and checks solutions to worksheet problems.

### Content Summary

1. A **number system** uses a **base** and **symbols** to represent values.
2. Common number systems include **decimal (base 10)**, **binary (base 2)**, **octal (base 8)**, and **hexadecimal (base 16)**.
3. Decimal-to-binary conversion uses repeated division by 2; binary-to-decimal conversion multiplies digits by place values and adds results.
4. Octal and hexadecimal conversions can be done by grouping binary digits in threes or fours.
5. Understanding number systems helps in **programming**, **data representation**, and **computer troubleshooting**.

### Conclusion

Teacher reminds students that digital devices rely on binary, so learning number systems builds strong computing foundations.
