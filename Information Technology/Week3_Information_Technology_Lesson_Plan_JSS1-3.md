DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 1st October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Number System
- **Subtopic:** Types of Number Systems Used in Computing
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Information Technology for JSS 2; Digital Logic Design Textbook; Computing Fundamentals Workbook
- **Instructional Materials:** Base conversion charts, number system flashcards, interactive base conversion software, worksheets
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can count numbers using the decimal system and have been introduced to binary digits.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Define a number system and identify base values.
  2. List different number systems relevant to computing.
  3. Convert numbers between decimal and binary, octal, or hexadecimal bases.
  4. Explain why computers use binary representation.
  5. Solve simple class exercises involving mixed base conversions.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher writes numbers in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal forms on the board and asks students to spot differences.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines a number system as a set of symbols and rules for representing numbers and explains base values.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher describes decimal (base 10), binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16) systems, highlighting symbols and place values.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students practise converting numbers between bases using worksheets and digital tools; teacher guides them through worked examples.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher gives quick oral questions on identifying bases and converting simple numbers to check understanding.

### Content Summary

1. A **number system** is a method of representing numbers using symbols and positional values.
2. Computing uses **decimal**, **binary**, **octal**, and **hexadecimal** systems.
3. Binary is used by computers because it matches the **two-state (on/off)** nature of electronic circuits.
4. Conversion between systems follows **place value rules** and **division or multiplication methods**.

### Conclusion

Teacher stresses that understanding number systems is essential for learning computer programming and data representation.

### Student Lesson Notes

- A **number system** uses symbols and rules to represent values.
- Important systems in computing are **decimal**, **binary**, **octal**, and **hexadecimal**.
- Computers use **binary** because electronic circuits work with two states.
- We convert numbers by using **division, multiplication, and place values**.

### Assignment

Convert the following numbers: (a) 45₁₀ to binary, (b) 110101₂ to decimal, (c) 157₈ to decimal, (d) 2F₁₆ to decimal.
