  5. Analyse how operating systems manage hardware and software resources.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays desktop and mobile OS interfaces, asking students to identify similarities and differences.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines an operating system as software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides services for computer programs.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher lists examples such as **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **Android**, **iOS**, and **Chrome OS**. Teacher explains functions including **booting the system**, **managing files**, **allocating memory**, **controlling input/output devices**, **providing a user interface**, and **ensuring security**.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students match OS function flashcards to real-life scenarios (e.g., printing a document, installing an app, switching between tasks) and discuss how the OS handles each task.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to define operating system, give examples, and explain key functions.

### Content Summary

1. An **operating system (OS)** is software that controls the **hardware** and **software** resources of a computer.
2. Examples include **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **Android**, **iOS**, and **Chrome OS**.
3. Major functions are **booting**, **managing files**, **allocating memory**, **handling input/output devices**, **providing user interfaces**, and **ensuring security**.
4. Operating systems coordinate user activities and make computers **easy to use**.

### Conclusion

Teacher highlights that without operating systems, computers cannot function effectively for users.
