- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Information Technology for Junior Secondary Schools JSS 2; Computer Studies for Nigerian Schools; Operating Systems textbooks and manuals
- **Instructional Materials:** Laptop or desktop computer, projector, charts showing operating system logos, screenshots of operating system interfaces
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have used mobile phones or computers and can mention system names like Windows or Android.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Define an operating system clearly.
  2. List at least five examples of operating systems across devices.
  3. Explain three major functions of an operating system.
  4. Identify operating system interfaces from screenshots or live demonstration.
  5. Describe how operating systems manage hardware, software, and user interaction.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays a powered-on computer and asks students what makes the computer respond to user commands.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines an operating system as the main software that manages computer hardware and software resources.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher lists examples of operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Chrome OS, explaining where each is used.

**Step 4 – Application:** Teacher demonstrates how the operating system manages files, runs applications, and handles input/output; students identify the functions being carried out.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks students to define an operating system, name examples, and state its functions.

### Content Summary

1. An **operating system (OS)** is software that controls computer hardware, runs applications, and manages user interaction.
2. Examples include **Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Chrome OS**.
3. Major functions: **managing hardware resources**, **providing a user interface**, **running and coordinating application software**, and **handling file management and security**.
4. Without an OS, computer hardware cannot function effectively for users.

### Conclusion

Teacher summarises that the operating system is the backbone of every computer system and mobile device.

### Student Lesson Notes

- An **operating system** makes the computer work by linking hardware with applications.
- Examples are **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, **Android**, **iOS**, and **Chrome OS**.
- The OS **manages memory and devices**, **provides menus and icons**, **runs programs**, and **protects files**.
- Every digital device needs an OS to function properly.

### Assignment

List five devices you use daily and write the operating system each device uses, if known.
