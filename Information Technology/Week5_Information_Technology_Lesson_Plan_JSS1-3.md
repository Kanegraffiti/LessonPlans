DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 15th October 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Number System
- **Subtopic:** Numbers in Different Bases
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Information and Communication Technology for JSS 2; Number Systems Workbook; Digital Electronics Basics Text
- **Instructional Materials:** Base conversion charts, binary and hexadecimal flashcards, place value tables, calculators, projector for conversion demonstrations
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students can convert simple numbers between base ten and binary from previous exercises.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students should be able to:
  1. Explain the concept of base in number systems.
  2. Identify digits allowed in base two, base eight, base ten, and base sixteen.
  3. Convert numbers from base ten to base two, eight, and sixteen.
  4. Convert numbers from base two or base eight back to base ten.
  5. Solve real-life examples where understanding different bases is important in computing.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher reviews place value in base ten and asks students to share experiences converting numbers to binary.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines a base as the number of unique digits used in a number system and introduces base two (binary), base eight (octal), base ten (decimal), and base sixteen (hexadecimal).

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher demonstrates step-by-step conversions between bases using division and multiplication methods, emphasising digits available in each base and how place values change.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students practise conversions in pairs using worksheets and calculators, then explain their methods to the class.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher gives quick oral and written exercises to confirm correct conversions and understanding of digits in each base.

### Content Summary

1. A **base** is the number of digits in a number system; base two uses digits **0 and 1**, base eight uses **0–7**, base ten uses **0–9**, and base sixteen uses **0–9 and A–F**.
2. Converting from decimal to another base involves **dividing by the new base** and recording remainders; converting back uses **place values**.
3. Binary and hexadecimal systems are important in **computer operations, programming, and digital electronics**.
4. Practising conversions improves understanding of how computers represent and process data.

### Conclusion

Teacher notes that mastering different bases prepares students for advanced computing topics.

### Student Lesson Notes

- The **base** tells how many digits a system uses (binary: 0,1; octal: 0–7; decimal: 0–9; hexadecimal: 0–9, A–F).
- To convert from decimal to another base, **divide by the base and record remainders**.
- To convert to decimal, **multiply each digit by its place value** and add the results.
- Knowing different bases helps in **programming, digital circuits, and data representation**.

### Assignment

Convert the decimal numbers 45 and 156 to binary, octal, and hexadecimal. Then convert the binary number 101101 back to decimal.
