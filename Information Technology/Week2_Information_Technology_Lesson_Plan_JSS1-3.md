- **Class:** JSS 1
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** First
- **Topic:** Historical Development of Computers
- **Subtopic:** Problems in Counting Large Numbers with Early Counting Devices
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Information Technology for Junior Secondary Schools; Computer Studies for Nigerian Schools JSS 1; Internet articles on early computing
- **Instructional Materials:** Pictures of tally sticks, abacus, pebble counters; improvised counting frame; chart showing population growth
- **Entry Behaviour:** Pupils have used fingers, sticks, or stones to count small quantities.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, pupils will be able to:
  1. Describe how early counting devices were used to solve basic counting problems.
  2. Explain difficulties faced when counting large numbers with devices like fingers, stones, and the abacus.
  3. Give examples of situations where early devices could not keep accurate records.
  4. Demonstrate how errors occur when using simple devices for big numbers.
  5. Discuss why the limitations of early devices led to the development of modern computers.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher asks pupils to count a large pile of bottle tops with their fingers and note the time taken and errors observed.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews early devices such as tally sticks, pebbles, and abacus, highlighting how they were used for trade and tax collection.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher explains the challenges of using these devices for large numbers: time-consuming, easy to misplace items, limited memory, and difficulty performing complex calculations.

**Step 4 – Application:** Pupils work in groups to attempt counting tasks using pebbles and an abacus; they record difficulties encountered and share findings.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher asks pupils to describe two problems faced when using early devices for large numbers and suggest why better machines were needed.

### Content Summary

1. Early counting tools such as **fingers**, **stones**, **tally sticks**, and **abacus** helped people keep simple records.
2. Counting large numbers with these devices caused problems like **loss of counters**, **slow calculations**, and **errors in recording**.
3. Traders and tax collectors needed faster, more accurate methods, leading to the invention of mechanical and electronic calculators.
4. The desire to solve counting problems encouraged the development of modern computers.

### Conclusion

Teacher summarises the limitations of early counting devices and links them to the emergence of modern computing systems.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Early counting devices worked for small numbers but became **slow and confusing** when numbers were large.
- People could easily **lose stones or tally marks**, making records incorrect.
- The **abacus** was faster but still required skilled users and could not store information for long periods.
- Because of these problems, inventors created better machines that could count and calculate accurately.
- Create a quick summary in your notebook highlighting the key terms, diagrams, and examples from this lesson.
- Teach a friend or family member what you learned to check your understanding and build confidence.


### Assignment

Describe two major problems people faced when using stones or tally sticks for large counting tasks and explain how modern computers solve those problems.


DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 24th September 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Computer Software
- **Subtopic:** Types and Examples of Software
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Information Technology for Junior Secondary Schools; Computer Studies Textbook for JSS 2; Software product brochures
- **Instructional Materials:** Computer system, projector slides showing software categories, flash cards with software names and icons
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have used different programs on the computer during previous lessons.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Classify software into system software and application software.
  2. Identify utility software and programming language translators as part of system software.
  3. Provide relevant examples of application software for education, business, and entertainment.
  4. Match software names to their correct categories during group activities.
  5. Explain why both system and application software are needed for computer operations.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays the desktop screen and asks students to name programs they can see and how they use them.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines system software and application software, providing clear distinctions.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher breaks down system software into operating systems, utility programs, and translators; presents application software examples such as word processors, spreadsheets, presentation tools, graphics editors, databases, browsers, and games.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups with flash cards to sort software into categories; each group explains reasons for their classification.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher gives quick oral questions asking students to state the category for listed software and mention their uses.

### Content Summary

1. Software is divided into **system software** (operating systems, utilities, language translators) and **application software** (programs that help users perform tasks).
2. **Operating systems** like Windows, Linux, Android control computer hardware; **utilities** such as antivirus, disk cleanup maintain the system.
3. **Application software** includes word processors (Microsoft Word), spreadsheets (Excel), presentation tools (PowerPoint), graphics editors (CorelDRAW), browsers (Chrome), educational apps, and games.
4. Both system and application software work together so that users can operate the computer effectively.

### Conclusion

Teacher reinforces that system software prepares the computer for use while application software allows users to carry out specific tasks.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **System software** controls the hardware and makes other software work properly.
- Examples include **operating systems**, **utility programs**, and **language translators** such as compilers and interpreters.
- **Application software** helps users perform jobs like typing documents, calculating results, browsing the internet, designing posters, and playing educational games.
- Without system software, application programs cannot run; without application software, users cannot do meaningful work on the computer.
- Create a quick summary in your notebook highlighting the key terms, diagrams, and examples from this lesson.
- Teach a friend or family member what you learned to check your understanding and build confidence.


### Assignment

Create a two-column table listing ten software programs you know. Indicate whether each one is system or application software and state its main function.
