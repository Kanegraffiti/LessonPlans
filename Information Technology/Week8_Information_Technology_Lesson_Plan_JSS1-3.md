DETAILED LESSON PLAN – JSS 2
-----------------------------

- **Date:** Wednesday, 5th November 2025
- **Class:** JSS 2
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Period:** Second
- **Topic:** Computer Problem-Solving Skills
- **Subtopic:** Computer Programmes
- **Reference Materials:** NERDC Information and Communication Technology for JSS 2; Introduction to Programming Textbook; Scratch Programming Guide
- **Instructional Materials:** Computer system or projector, flowchart templates, sample pseudocode, simple Scratch or block-based programming environment, problem-solving worksheet
- **Entry Behaviour:** Students have basic knowledge of computer operations and have seen simple programmes executing tasks.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Explain what a computer programme is and its role in problem solving.
  2. Describe the steps involved in solving a problem using a computer (problem definition, analysis, algorithm design, coding, testing).
  3. Interpret simple flowcharts and pseudocode that represent problem-solving steps.
  4. Develop a basic algorithm for a real-life problem and represent it in pseudocode or a block-based programme.
  5. Evaluate their programme by testing with sample data and suggesting improvements.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher presents a real-life scenario (calculating average test scores) and asks students how a computer could solve it.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher defines a computer programme as a set of instructions written in a programming language to solve a specific problem.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher outlines the problem-solving cycle: define the problem, analyse requirements, design algorithms, write programmes, test and debug, and document solutions.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in pairs to create a flowchart and pseudocode for calculating average test scores, then implement the solution using a block-based programming tool or structured pseudocode.

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher reviews each pair’s solution, asking them to explain their algorithm, demonstrate the programme with sample data, and identify possible improvements.

### Content Summary

1. A **computer programme** is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do to solve a problem.
2. Problem-solving steps include **definition**, **analysis**, **algorithm design**, **coding**, **testing**, and **documentation**.
3. Tools such as **flowcharts**, **pseudocode**, and **block-based programming environments** help in planning and implementing programmes.
4. Testing ensures that programmes work correctly and efficiently before they are used in real situations.

### Conclusion

Teacher reminds students that careful planning before coding leads to efficient and error-free programmes.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Computer programmes are **instructions** written to solve a problem or perform a task.
- We solve problems by **defining the problem**, **planning a solution**, **writing the instructions**, and **testing** the programme.
- Flowcharts and pseudocode help us organise our ideas before writing the final programme.

### Assignment

Write pseudocode for a programme that finds the largest of three numbers entered by a user. Include steps for input, comparison, and output.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups using screenshots or simulations to practise selecting the correct antivirus task, interpret scan results, and compile safe computing tips (regular updates, avoiding suspicious downloads, using strong passwords, backing up data).

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher assesses understanding by asking students to list steps for running an antivirus scan, explain the purpose of updates, and describe actions to take when a virus is detected.

### Content Summary

1. **Antivirus software** detects, prevents, and removes viruses using **virus definitions**, **heuristic analysis**, and **real-time scanning**.
2. Signs of infection include **slow performance**, **unexpected pop-ups**, **files disappearing**, and **system crashes**.
3. Regularly updating antivirus software and performing scheduled scans keep computers protected.
4. Safe practices—such as **avoiding suspicious links**, **using trusted storage devices**, and **backing up data**—support virus detection and prevention.

### Conclusion

Teacher highlights that proactive virus detection protects data, hardware, and user privacy, and encourages students to apply safe computing habits daily.
