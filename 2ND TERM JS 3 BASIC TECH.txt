WEEK TWO

CLASS: Basic 9

TOPIC: Mechanical Energy Transmission system

Period one: Friction

Content; -Definition of friction

- Nature/characteristics of friction

- Types of frictional force

- Effect of friction

- Advantages of friction

- Disadvantages of friction

- Methods of reducing friction

Definition of friction

Friction can be defined as a force which opposes motion.

It is a force which stops/prevents motion. It acts whenever there is
motion or tendency for something to move. i.e friction (or frictional
force) is absent if there is no motion or if there is no force intending
to cause motion.It stops your car when the brake is applied. It prevents
your foot from slipping backward when you walk.

Friction can also be defined as a force of attraction between the
molecules of two bodies in contact which prevents relative motion
between the two bodies.

[]

friction is preventing this box from moving.

Nature/characteristics of friction

- It always opposes motion

- It depends on the nature of surfaces in contact. Friction between
  rough surfaces is greater than the frictional force between smooth
  surfaces.

- It does not depend on the relative speed between the two surfaces.

- It is directly proportional to the perpendicular force (normal
  reaction) between the two surfaces.(R is the perpendicular force
  between the two surfaces in contact)

  R

  Fα R

  F = µR

  F – Frictional force, R – normal reaction, µ - coefficient of friction
  W

Note that R = W for bodies on horizontal surfaces

Questions: A crate slid down an inclined plane such that the frictional
force opposing its motion is 40N. If the normal reaction of the plane on
the crate is 50N, calculate the coefficient of dynamic friction.

Solution: Frictional force F = 40N

Normal reaction R = 50N

Coefficient of friction µ= ?

F=µR

40 = µ x 50 (dividing both sides by 50)

⁴⁰/₅₀ = µ

µ = 0.8

Types of friction

There are two types of frictional force

1.  Static friction. This occurs between two bodies that are not moving
    or at rest.

2.  Dynamic friction. This occurs between two bodies in relative motion.

Effects of friction

Friction can best be imagined whenever there is motion or likelihood of
motion. Friction exists in all machines or systems with moving parts.
Friction also applies in many day to day phenomena such as; walking on a
pavement, pulling the rope of a pulley system, dragging a crate on the
floor, using a grinding stone for blending, loosing or tightening a nut
and bolt,… . Effects of friction can be classified as desirable or
undesirable.

Advantages of friction (or desirable effects of friction)

I.  Locomotion: when we walk, friction between our shoes and the ground
    prevents our shoes from slipping backward.

II. Enhances fastening: friction between the bolt and the nut enhances
    their fastening ability. The friction between nails and wood also
    help the nail to hold woods together in firm position.

III. Blending: friction between the grinding stones helps in grinding
     pepper, tomatoes,this is also true of the friction between the two
     rough discs of the grinding machine.

IV. Stops motion: friction between the car tyre and the road helps to
    stop the motion of a moving car when the brake is applied.

V.  Production of electric charge: when certain materials are robbed
    against each other, static electric charges is produced. This
    principle is applied in the Van de Graff generator.

VI. Use of Ladder: when a ladder to be used to climb over a wall rest on
    the wall, friction between the foot of the ladder and floor prevent
    the foot of the ladder from slipping.

VII. Making of fire: matches sticks are ignited when they are robbed
     against the side of the matches’ box.Fire can also be made by
     striking two stones together.

Disadvantages of friction (or undesirable effects of friction)

- Wearing: The thread pattern under your footwear soon wear out after a
  prolong use due to friction. This is also true of the thread on the
  tyre of cars and other automobile.

- Tearing/cutting: you can easily cut a piece of rope or cloth by
  robbing it repeatedly against the edge of the wall.

- Reduces efficiency of machines: all machines have efficiency less than
  100% due to friction between their moving parts. Friction causes waste
  of useful energy,thereforeit reduces the output of the machine.

- Generation of undesirable heat: moving machine parts/machine itself
  soon becomes hot due friction and this may necessitate cooling of
  machine parts.

Methods of reducing friction

Due to the disadvantages of friction mentioned above, it is often
necessary to reduce friction in machines. This is possible through any
of the following methods:

1.  Lubrication: this is the use of certain substances (called
    lubricants) to reduce the effects of friction. Examples of
    lubricants includes, grease, oil,… many of which are petroleum
    products.

2.  Use of rollers

3.  Use of ball bearing

4.  Use of belt/chain drive

Period two: Belt and Chain drive

Content:

- Drives

- Belt drive

- Types of belt drive

- Belt tensioning

- Application of belt drive

- Chain drive

- Application of chain drive

- Difference between chain drive and gear drive

Drives: Drivesare devices used to transmit rotary motion from one shaft
to another.

The drive mechanism is used in transmitting power from one location to
another

There are three types of drives:

1.  Belt and pulley drive

2.  Chain drives

3.  Gear drives

Belt drive

This is a device used to transfer power/motion from one shaft to another
shaft parallel to it and at some distance away. Belt drives are often
used in place of chain drive when slip is not so important to be taken
into consideration. Hence, belt cannot provide positive drive because
slip occurs from time to time.

Types of belt drive

There are two types of belt drive based on the shape of the belt:

1.  Straight (flat) belt

2.  V- shaped belt

Belt can be lapped over the groove pulley in two styles. This includes:

i.  Straight belt lap: Here the two pulleys join by the belt rotate in
    the same direction.

ii. Cross belt lap: Here the two pulleys join by the belt rotate in
    opposite

_(Straight belt lap cross belt lap)

Belt tensioning

Sometimes, a belt in use is slack and may be slipping over the pulley.
Such belts that are not taut do not transmit motion/power effectively
thereby wasting energy. This could be prevented by tensioning the belt
drive.

To tension a belt, another pulley (wheel called the idler) mounted on a
separate shaft is used.

Idler

Application of belt drive

1.  They are used to couple a diesel engine to an alternator to generate
    electricity

2.  They are used in cassava grinding machines

3.  They are used for the radiator of cars.

4.  They are used for tape recorders/ video cassette players

5.  They are used in the engines of automobiles (Volkswagens –tortoise
    car)

6.  They are used in block making machines

Chain drives

They are used for transferring power/motion from one shaft to another
just as in the case for belt drive. Chain is always used in conjunction
with a sprocket for transmitting power. A sprocket is a toothed wheel or
a wheel with many contours round its circumference. The number of teeth
on the sprockets determines the speed of rotation of the driven
sprocket.

One advantage of the chain and sprocket drive over the belt drive is
that it has a firmer grip on the area of lap than the belt drive. Chain
drives do not allow slip unlike belt drive. Also, power is transmitted
positively in chain driveand not by friction as in the case of belt
drives.

In chain drive, the driver and the driven sprocket rotate in the same
direction just as in the caseofstraight belt lap. Both the chain drive
and the belt drives are used to transmit power and motion between two
shafts at some distance apart.

Applications of chain drive.

1.  The motorcycle chain drive

2.  The bicycle chain and sprocket drive.

3.  Mechanical saw for slicing wood.

Gear drive

This isa device used to transmit motion between parallel or inclined
shafts that are close to each other (such that the tooth on the wheel
mounted on the shafts mesh together). When two gears are in mesh, they
are called GEAR TRAIN. Friction always occurs between the meshed teeth
of the gear train. Constant lubrication is therefore necessary to
prevent wearing. The teeth on each gears in mesh must be uniformly
spaced around the gear (that is symmetrical) for them to mesh properly
and to prevent damage of the tooth. Improperly meshed gears can also
lead to seizure of the gear train.

Seizure is the total movement stoppage of the gear train.

Unlike the belt and the chain drive, the driver and the driven gear move
in different direction. To make the driver and the driven gear move in
the same direction, another gear (called the IDLER) is inserted between
the two (driver and the driven gear).

Types of gears

1.  Spur gear: this has teeth parallel to the shaft of the gear.

2.  Helical gear: this has teeth inclined to the shaft of the gear.

3.  Worm gears: these are gears formed when a spur gear mesh with a
    screw.

4.  Rack and pinion: these are gears that run on a flat toothed rack.

5.  Planetary gears: these consist of a number of spur gear meshed with
    one another and another gear with internal gear.

6.  Bevel gears: these are gears used when power is to be transmitted
    between inclined shafts

Uses of gear drive

1.  To transmit motion between two inclined or parallel shafts.

2.  To change direction of motion.

3.  For speed selection.

Gear ratio

This can be defined as the ratio of the number of teeth on the driver
gear to that on the driven gear

$G = \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}$ T­­­­­­­­­­­­­₁is number of teeth on driver gear

T₂is number of teeth on driven gear

Speed ratio

This can be defined as the ratio of the speed of the driven gear to the
speed of the driver gear.

$\mathbf{S =}\frac{\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{2}}}{\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{1}}}$ S₁
speed of the driver gear

S₂is speed of the driven gear

The gear ratio and the speed ratio of a gear train are equal. The speed
of rotation of the driven gear depends on the number of teeth on the
driven and the driver gear.Where a large increase in speed is desired
(like in the case of motor car), a compound gear train is used.

[C:\Users\KOLAWOLE S.KOLAWOLES\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary
Internet Files\Content.Word\100_1441.jpg]Compound gear

The speed of the driven gear S₂ is given as

$$\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{2\ }}\mathbf{=}\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{1\ }}\mathbf{\times \ }\frac{\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{1}}}{\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{2}}}$$

Where each symbols has it usual meaning.

Changing the direction of drive,

Chain drives cannot be used for changing the direction of rotationof
drives. Belt drive cannot be used to change direction of rotation of
drive except when belt is crossed. Gears can be used for changing the
direction of motion. The bevelled gear is often used for changing
direction of motion between two perpendicular/inclined shafts.

  CALCULATIONS ON GEAR AND SPEED RATIO

Question 1: the number of teeth on the driver and the driven gear is 12
and 16 respectively. If the speed of the driver gear is 100rev/min,
calculate (i) the gear ratio (ii) speed of the driven gear

Solution

Number of teeth on the driver gear T₁ = 12

Number of teeth on the driven gear T₂ = 16

(i) Gear ratio G = ?$G = \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}$

$$G\  = \ \frac{12}{16\ }\  = \ \frac{3}{4}$$

Gear ratio G =$\frac{3}{4}$

(ii) Speed of the driver gear S₁ = 100rpm

Speed of the driven gear S₂=
?$S_{2} = \ S_{1\ } \times \ \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}$

$$S_{2}\  = 100\  \times \frac{12}{16} = 75rpm$$

Speed of the driven gear S₂ = 75 rpm

Question 2: A gear train is such that the number of teeth on the driver
gear is 20 while that on the driven is 8. If the speed of the driver
gear is 150rev/min. calculate the speed of the driven gear.

Solution

Number of teeth of the driver gear T₁ = 20

Number of teeth on the driven gear T₂ = 8

Speed of the driver gear S₁ = 150rpm

Speed of the driven gear S₂= ?

$$S_{2} = S_{1} \times \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}$$

$$S_{2} = 150\  \times \ \frac{20}{8}\  = 375rpm\ $$

Speed of the driven gear S₂ = 375rpm

Question 3: in a compound gear train, the effective gear ratio is
$\frac{16}{5}$ . if the speed of the driver gear is 100rev/min,
calculate the speed of the driven gear.

Solution

Speed of the driver gear S₁ = 100rpm

Gear ratio $G\  = \ \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}} = \ \frac{16}{5}$

Speed of driven gear S₂= ?

$$S_{2} = \ S_{1} \times \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}$$

$$S_{2} = 100\  \times \ \frac{16}{5} = 320rpm$$

Speed of the driven gear S₂= 320rpm

Question 4: A gear train has a gear ratio of $\frac{5}{2}$ and a driven
gear rotating at a speed of 180revolution per minute. What would have
been the speed of the driver gear?

Solution

Speed of the driven gear S₂ = 180rpm

Gear ratio $G\  = \ \frac{5}{2}$

Speed of the driver gear S₁= ?

$$S_{2} = \ S_{1} \times \frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}$$

$$180\  = \ S_{1} \times \frac{5}{2}$$

$$180\  = \frac{S_{1} \times 5}{2}$$

180  × 2 = S₁  × 5

$$S_{1} = \frac{180\  \times 2}{5}\  = 72\ rpm$$

Speed f the driver gear S₁ = 72rpm

WEEK 4

TOPIC MOTION

CONTENT:

- Motion

- Linear motion

- Rotary motion

MOTION

This can be defined as thechange in position of objects. This is a
common phenomenon in nature. The moon moves, we human move from one
place to another… . It is also a common practice for various component
of a mechanical system to move relatively to one another; examples
include: the needle of a sewing machine at work, the tyre of a moving
car etc

Mechanical systems are commonly engaged in basically TWO types of
motion.

1.  Linear motion

2.  Rotary motion

Linear motion:

This can be defined as change in position in a straight line. Like the
motion of the needle of the sewing machine or motion of a crane being
hauled up using a pulley. There are different types/parts of a
mechanical system that exhibit this type of motion. They include;

1.  Lever: It helps us to do work easily. Examples are the crowbar, the
    door knob etc. It often has a pivot (or a point of support) about
    which the lever turns. This point is called fulcrum.An example is a
    crowbar.

2.  Linkages; this is an assembly of metallic bars in which each bar is
    connected to at least two other bars in an elbow/sliding joint. They
    are often used for converting linear motion to rotary motion and
    vice versa or for converting a linear motion to another linear
    motion but in the opposite direction.Application of linkage include,
    bicycle brake, crank and slide

  Rotary motion:

  This can be defined as change in position aroundfixed axis.Like the
  motion of the blade of a ceiling fan or the tyre of a moving car.
  There are two types of rotary motion:

i.  One way rotary motion: This allows continuousrotation and can only
    be brought to rest by the application of a brake.Examples include
    the clock mechanism, the circular mechanical saws for cutting wood,
    shaft of cars… .

  Note that in some of these motions, reversibility may be required (
  e.g shaft of a moving car, trains or crane) while for others
  reversibility may be dangerous and need to be prohibited (e.g circular
  saw for cutting wood, clock mechanism) and their motions can be
  controlled by the ratchet wheel

  [C:\Users\KOLAWOLE S.KOLAWOLES\Documents\My Received
  Files\100_1431.JPG]

ii. Non return rotary motion: This allows intermittent rotation but only
    in one direction. i.e the motion can stop and continue at intervals
    in the same direction.

  EVALUATION

I.  State one difference between the one-way rotary motion and the
    non-return rotary motion.

II. Mention three mechanical systems in linear motion.

III. List some applications of the linkage system.

  Sub topic 2

- Control of rotary motion

- Conversion of rotary to linear motion

  Control of rotary motion

  Thisinvolves the use of devices for initiating and arresting the flow
  of motion. These devices include;

1.  Brakes

2.  Clutch

3.  Ratchet

  Brakes; These are devices used to slow down or bring to a complete
  stop a moving body. Brakes are used for removing kinetic energy form
  moving bodies. There are different types of brakes

i.  Disc brake; used for light vehicles

ii. Drum brakes; used for heavy vehicles

iii. External block brakes; used for cranes and winches

iv. Internal shoe brake; used for motorcycles and other small
    automobiles.

TOPIC: AIR FLOW

CONTENT

- Air flow

- Bernoulli’s principle

- Aerodynamics

  Air flow

  This refers to air molecules in motion. Flow is an exclusive property
  of all fluids (liquids and gases). However unlike liquids, air does
  not necessarily need a channel or container for it to flow.
  Breeze/wind is formed when molecules of air are set in
  motion.Molecules of air can be set in motion by any of the following
  processes:

i.  Blowing air

ii. Using the bellows (often used by blacksmith)

iii. Using pumps

iv. Using fan

  When liquids flow through channels, agents such as gravity or a
  mechanical device is necessary to sustain the flow. Liquid (water)
  flow could either be laminar (streamline) or turbulent.

  In laminar flow, all the portions of the water move gently in a path
  parallel to the confining channel.

  Turbulent flow is a force flow; water particles do not move in a
  straight line. An example of this is the water flow in drainage during
  a heavy downpour.

  Moving air molecules possess energy. This energy can be applied in the
  following processes;

- Action of the wind mill

- Movement offlag attached to flag pole.

- Destructive action of the hurricane

  When air moves over the surface of an object at high speed, the
  pressure on the surface is greatly reduced (i.e the faster air
  molecules move over a surface the lesser the pressure acting on the
  surface). This principle is called the Bernoulli’s principle. This
  principle is used for explaining the lift force experienced by
  helicopters and aeroplanes when they are in air. To demonstrate this
  principle, you may try blowing air between two papers; you’ll observe
  that the papers move toward each other instead of going apart. This is
  because increase in the speed of air between the papers result in
  decrease in the pressure between the papers.

  A science that studies the force on object moving through air is
  called Aerodynamics.

  Aeroplanes’ wings are designed to have a streamline shape which allows
  the air above it to move faster than the air under it. The pressure
  under the aeroplane is therefore greater than that above the aeroplane
  thereby resulting in net pressure acting under the aeroplane as well
  as a lift force on the plane. The streamline shape of the aircraft
  also minimises the frictional drag force opposing the motion of the
  plane.

  The drag force acts on the aeroplane in a direction perpendicular to
  the lift force. Summarily, four forces act on a body moving through
  air: L

i.  The weight(W) of the body which act downward

ii. The lift force(L) which act upwardTD

iii. The drag force(D) which opposes the motion of the bodies

iv. The thrust(T) of body itself moving it forwardW[C:\Users\KOLAWOLE

Air Compressor

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Air Compressor, also air pump is a machine that decreases the volume  |
| and increases the pressure of a quantity of air by mechanical means.  |
| Air thus compressed possesses great potential energy, because when    |
| the external pressure is removed, the air expands rapidly. The        |
| controlled expansive force of compressed air is used in many ways and |
| provides the motive force for air motors and tools, including         |
| pneumatic hammer, air drills, sandblasting machines, and paint        |
| sprayers.                                                             |

  Hydraulic lift

  This applies the Pascal’s principle of transmissibility of pressure to
  generate a huge force by applying a small effort.

  []

A small force can be used to lift a heavy car using the hydraulic lift.
Many other hydraulic systems (e.g hydraulic press, hydraulic water pump,
hydraulic jack…) also apply this principle.

Garden sprinkler

This applies the Newton’s third law of motion which states that for
every action there is an equal but opposing reaction. When water is
ejected from the nozzle of the sprinkler, the forward thrust of the
water result in a backward push on the nozzle thereby making the
sprinkler turn about it axis watering several portion of the garden and
not just on a single spot.

Sub-Topic 1: Meaning of electrical circuit and types.

An electric circuit is a system that consists of the load, source of
electricity, the key or switch and the connecting wires.

There are two types of electrical circuits (i) Series circuit (ii)
parallel circuit.

Series circuit: In this arrangement, the load(resistors) are connected
end to end. The same current flows through all appliances. If one stops
functioning, the others stop.

Series circuit

Parallel circuit: In this arrangement, the load(resistors) are connected
side by side in parallel order. The same voltage is used. A fault which
may occur in one electrical path will not affect the others.

Parallel circuit

SUB-TOPICS:

- Definition and function of foundation

- Types and materials for making walls

Content Development (NOTES FOR FIRST LESSON/PERIOD ONE)

sub-Topic I: Definition and function of foundation

Foundation.

The term foundation is the expanded base of a column in addition to the
ground or sub-soil which supports the base. The ground or sub soil on
which the building stands is the natural foundation, while the expanded
base which is constructed of concrete or mansory materials like rocks,
stones, bricks is called artificial foundation. The choice of foundation
depends on the type of building to be constructed, the load imposed on
the building and the type and nature of the soil.

Functions of foundation:

1. To receive the weight of the building.

2. To distribute the weight of the building to the ground effectively.

3. To hold the building firmly to the ground against external forces
like wind, storms.

4. To transmit the weight of the building to the sub-soil or ground.

5. To sustain the dead load of the building.

Types of foundation:

1. Strip foundation: This consists of a continuous strip of concrete
laid on the trench after excavation. It is usually 225mm thick and used
for bungalows, fences etc and on a moderately hard soil.

[C:\Users\Anicho\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet
Files\Content.Word\100_1458.jpg]

2. Pad foundation: This type of foundation is an isolated foundation
used to support columns. The size of the pad foundation could be reduced
by providing steel reinforcement towards the bottom of the foundation
running in both directions. It is used for storey building.

[C:\Users\Anicho\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet
Files\Content.Word\100_1459.jpg]

3. Raft foundation: This is used where the load bearing capacity of the
soil is weak. It is used on sandy, swampy or marshy ground. It consists
of reinforcement slab up to 300mm thick. It covers the whole area of the
building and usually extends beyond it.

[C:\Users\Anicho\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet
Files\Content.Word\100_1461.jpg]

4. Piled foundation: This is used for multistory buildings, for supports
in bridges and water logged areas to support the structures. The imposed
load is transmitted to suitable materials in a lower stratum by the use
of piles.

Sub-Topic II: Types and materials for making walls.

Wall: It is a structural member in building(450mm) used mainly for the
enclosure or division of a space within a building. It canbe external
wall or load bearing wall built right from the foundation to the roof
level, it carries the weight of itself and some other elements e.g roof.

It can be internal cross walls, they are the non-load bearing
wall(150mm), it carries only the weight of itself.

Function of a wall:

i. To carry the load and other elements in the building structure.

ii. To divide a space as partition and as a compartment wall.

iii. To protect the structure against weather.

iv. For privacy

v. For security purpose

Walling Materials: They include stone, clay and mud, Timber, Bricks,
sand creates blocks etc.

Types of walls: There are many types of walls, depending on the
materials used and the method of construction.

i. Block wall ii. Partition wall iii. Sleeper wall iv. Timber wall v.
Foundation wall vi. Glass wall vii. Retaining wall viii. Cavity wall ix.
Reinforced concrete walls x. Stone wall xi. Bamboo wall xii. Clay or mud
wall xiii.Masonry wall.

WALL FINISHES: They are materials used to protect the surface of a wall
from weather element. The common wall finishing are Plastering,
rendering and painting.

Plastering: This is the type of finishing that is given to the internal
wall of a building. Cement and sand are mixed with water in ratio 1:3
with the help of hand Trowel. Two or three layers of plastering are
recommended on the surface of a masonry wall.

Rendering: This is the type of finishing that is given to the external
wall of a building. This can be done using

i. Mixture of cement, sand and water and applied to the surface of the
wall with hand trowel.

ii. Pebble dash: This is done by throwing about 10mm size of gravel on
the surface of the external wall.

iii. Spattered dash finish: This is done by spraying about ratio 1:6
(cement and sand ratio) mixture containing colored pigment on the
surface of the wall.

Painting: This is a liquid coating applied on the surface of a building
wall for the purpose of decoration and protection from the elements of
weather.

BONDING: This refers to the arrangement of bricks or blocks in a way
that a brick or block rests on at least 2 others so that continuous
vertical joint which reduces strength and stability in walls is
eliminated.

Sub-Topic 1: FLOOR

  Floors

  Floors are the horizontal components of buildings that support all
  imposed load. Floors normally satisfy a number of requirements
  depending on their location.

  Types of Floors.

  a. Solid Floors: Solid floors usually consist of concrete, which may
  simply be finished with a smooth surface or laid with tiles (plastic
  and linoleum floor tiles), which are not normally laid down in the
  specifications.

  b. Suspended Floors: These consist of wood, which are nailed over
  solid lengths of timber, the ends of which are supported by the many
  walls of the building. These solid timbers are known as joists, and
  they vary according to the type of house.

  Suspended timber ground floors are susceptible to dry rot, because of
  lack of ventilation. This situation of fungus attack could be overcome
  by providing air bricks in the external walls at suitable distances
  around the perimeter of the building.

  Types of floor based on method of construction:

  1. The Basement floor: This is the floor below ground level and is
  used mostly for car parks.

  2. The Ground floor: This is floor on ground level.

  3. The Upper floor: This is the floor above the ground level.

  Damp proof course (D.P.C): It is a layer of material capable of
  preventing the penetration of moisture which is embedded in the walls
  just below the exposed surface through which water can percolate. A
  properly placed D.P.C will prevent blistering of paint, rotting of
  timber and bulging of plaster.

  General floor finishes.

  a. Cement screed: this is a mixture of cement and sand and is common
  for most ordinary dwelling houses. Carpet or linoleum is usually used
  on such floors. They can also be painted.

  b. Floor tiles: A variety of tiles made of wood, ceramics and
  thermoplastics are available for floor finishes.

  c. Terrazzo : This is a very good but costly finish and is used for
  high class jobs.

  d. Timber: Timber is also used and requires to be polished.

Sub-Topic 2: Doors, Windows and Openings.

  A door is a solid flat barrier that closes the opening entrance to a
  building or a room. The principal function of a door to a building is
  to prevent unrestricted access to an enclosed space. In other words,
  entrances and exits into and from buildings, rooms, etc are possible
  only through doors.

  Functions of doors

- They provide inlets and out-lets to the building and its various
  compartments or rooms.

- They provide security to the building. Unwanted elements (e.g
  mosquitoes, wild animals, thieves etc) can be shut off.

- Doors contribute to the beauty of the building.

  Types of doors: Interior doors and exterior doors.

  Interior doors: there are four types of doors generally used as
  interior doors, they are:

  Panel door ii. Flush door iii. French door iv. Louvre door

  Exterior doors: Usually exterior doors are of solid core construction.
  They may be wooden or glass doors, they may be panel or flush doors.

  Sliding door: these are space saving doors which are used for closets
  in bedrooms, etc their installation usually requires the making of
  special panels by the craftsman, with the manufacturers providing the
  tracks and other necessary hardwares.

  Revolving doors: these are usually traffic control doors within a
  building. The door normalizes inward and outward movements with its
  four leaves revolving on a pivot, thereby allowing a person in and out
  in turns.

  Folding door or Roller shutter door: these are doors which are easily
  installed, as they take little space. These types of doors are mostly
  made of metals.

  Diagram

  [C:\Users\Anicho\Documents\My Received Files\100_1447.JPG]

  Door sizes

  Door can be made to any specified size depending on the use and choice
  of the designer or owner. Some standard sizes include:

  826 x 2049mm. Usually used as external doors.

  726 x 2040mm. Suitable for most internal doors.

  626 x 2040mm. Usually used for cupboards and cloakrooms.

  526 x 2040mm.Usually used for small cupboards.

  The normal thickness of the above door size is usually 40mm.

  Door frames

  A door-set consists of a door plus the frame. It is the frame which
  holds the door in position so that it can open or close. The frame is
  normally fixed in position either during the construction of the wall
  or thereafter. A frame consists of three members, these are two posts
  which are secured at the top to a cross-piece called the head. The
  head usually has horns which are some 50 to 100 mm projections of the
  head beyond the posts. The horns assist in making the frame secure
  when it is built into the wall. In order that the door may be well
  received by the frame, a 13 to 16mm deep recess or rebate is formed
  round the frame.

  Mounting of doors.

  Doors are mounted on frames which are already positioned on the walls
  by the use of hardwares such as hinges and fittings such as bolts and
  locks. It also includes door handles or knobs.

  Window: A window is an opening in wall, designed for the purpose of
  admitting light and air into an enclosed space. Occupants of a
  building can also have an outside view through the window. Majority of
  today’s designs emphasize windows as decorative structures, as
  portrayed by their shapes and sizes, which are better installed into
  frames.

  Types of windows:

  i. Casement window ii. Louvered window iii. Double hung window iv.
  French window v. Hopper window vi. Sliding window

  Diagram

  Lintel: A lintel is a horizontal beam supporting a wall over an
  opening of relatively short span. The lintel spans an opening to carry
  the load above the opening and to transmit the same load to the wall
  on either side of the opening. A lintel could be of concrete, wood or
  metal.

  Functions of Lintel

(i) Lintel is used to support wall block/bricks set above the openings.
    Such as doors and windows.

(ii) Lintel is also used to support the roof.

(iii) Lintel such as arch and vaults are designed to beautify the

Content Development (NOTES FOR FIRST LESSON/PERIOD ONE)

Sub-Topic I: Roof

Roof is the top feature in a building structure which provides covering
for the entire building and protect any internal decoration or fittings
from the weather thereby rendering the house habitable. The roof of a
building is supported by frame work of Ridges, Trusses, purling,
Rafters, Eaves.

Roofs perform specific functions which include:

- Weather Resistance: The roof must be water proof and shield the house
  from the direct rays of the sun.

- Strength: The roof must be strong enough to be able to carry its own
  weight and the superimposed weight of wind, and foot traffic for a
  considerable length of time without failing.

Types of common roof

a.  Hipped roof: the hip roof has four slanting surfaces from a peak
    known as ridge. The construction has a shortening effect on the
    length of the building visually. The hip roof is widely used for
    most houses in Nigeria.

b.  Pitched roof: This is often called gable roof. This type of roof is
    very common because it can be constructed easily. A typical
    characteristic of pitched roof is a cavity wall at the gable end,
    and vent between the fascia and soffit which prevents the rafter
    timbers from disintegration.

c.  Shed roof: this is the simplest form of roof construction, having
    only one slope usually to the rear of the building. The overhang of
    the roof is usually greater at the front and the design has added
    simplicity and attractiveness to modern building construction.

d.  Butterfly roof: this is double shed roof which slopes inwards with
    the low points to the centre of the building. It has a wide
    overhanging at the front and at the back which protects the walls
    from rains. It is mostly used where a large span is to be covered.

e.  Monitor roof: the roof has two surfaces on either side of the house,
    with the lower one and vents or lightning spaces fixed vertically
    between them. It is commonly used for large factory buildings or
    warehouses.

f.  Half Monitor roof: this roof has two surfaces only. One surface is
    lowered on one side while the other is raised a little above the
    lower one in the centre. The gap between the upper and lower central
    edges of the roof along the length is usually fitted with
    ventilation devices for roof members.

g.  Combination roof: this roof has two surfaces sloping away more on
    one side than on the other. The greater slope is usually on top of
    the rooms while the smaller slope usually covers the veranda portion
    of the house. It is mostly used in school building construction.

h.  Arched roof: this type of roof is usually used for large span
    construction work. The top is rounded and most economical in timber
    consumption. It could be made in the workshop and ready for fixing
    on the site.

i.  Mansard roof: Mansard roof has double slopes on each side. Although
    not common nowadays, mansard roof allows the use of the space in the
    roof area. The lower part of the roof which is fitted with dormer
    windows has a steep pitch, while the upper part has a slope of about
    30˚.
