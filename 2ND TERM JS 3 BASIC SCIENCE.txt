MEANING OF ATOM

Matter (solid, liquid or gas) is made up of tiny particles called atoms.

An atom is the smallest particle of matter which can take part in a
chemical reaction.

An English Chemist called John Dalton (1766 - 1844) put forward some
statements about the atom in1803 and 1808 which are referred to as
Dalton’s atomic theory. These helped to explain some observations about
the structure and behavior of atoms. However with advancement in science
and the contribution of more scientists like J.J Thomson in 1897, Robert
Millikan in1909-1916 and Earnest Rutherford in 1911, the theory has been
modified. Presently, scientists agree that:

1.  An atom is made up of a number of small particles namely, the
    electron, the proton and the neutron. None of these can exist on its
    own naturally.

2.  An atom is the smallest particle of matter that can take part in a
    chemical reaction.

3.  In nuclear reactions atoms can be created or destroyed.

4.  Some atoms of the same element have different masses for example in
    those elements that have isotopes.

5.  Most inorganic compounds are formed by the joining of atoms of two
    or more elements in a definite whole number ratio, but for large
    organic molecules such as proteins, fats and starches which involve
    the joining of thousands of atoms, this theory does not hold.

CONCEPT OF ELECTRONS, PROTONS AND NEUTRONS

An atom is made up of three fundamental particles; the electrons,
protons and neutrons. Structurally, an atom consists of a small dense,
centrally placed nucleus which is surrounded by electrons. The nucleus
is made up of the protons and the neutrons. The protons and neutrons are
collectively called the nucleons. Most of the atom is empty space. Most
of the mass is concentrated in the nucleus.

ELECTRONS: These are tiny particles situated at a comparatively great
distance from the centre of the atom. They travel rapidly and
continuously in orbits around the nucleus. An electron has a negative
charge and a very negligible mass of about 9.1 × 10⁻²⁸g, this is about
1800 times lighter than the hydrogen atom.

PROTONS: These are tiny, positively charged particles found in the
nucleus of an atom. The positive charge is equal in magnitude to the
negative charge on the electron. Thus, an atom with the same number of
electrons and protons is electrically neutral. The mass of the proton is
1 × 10⁻²⁴g, which is about 1800 times larger than that of the electron.

NEUTRONS: These are tiny particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They
have no electric charge i.e. they are neutral. Neutrons have about the
same mass as a proton.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sub- atomic Particle    Unit of electric charge Relative mass
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  Proton                  + 1                     1.00

  Electron                - 1                     1/1840

  Neutron                 none                    1.00
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

EVALUATION

1.  What is an atom?

2.  Name the fundamental particles of an atom

3.  State the charges on these particles and their relative masses.

4.  Who was the first chemist to propound theories about atoms?

Sub-Topic 2: SIMPLE ATOMIC MODEL

Ernest Rutherford in 1909 proposed a model of the atom. His model showed
a small dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by relatively empty
space and electrons continuously orbiting the nucleus at a great
distance from it. However in the light of further experimental results,
other models of the atom have been proposed.

The electrons occupy different orbits or shells called K,L,M,N, shells
or 1,2,3,4, shells round the nucleus. These shells may also have sub
shells designated s, p d, subshells.

Examples are;

(i) Hydrogen

Electron on K shell

Nucleus

(ii) Sodium

M shell

L shell

K shell

STRUCTURE OF MATTER

[C:\Users\JAMES COMFORT O\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary
Internet Files\t978594a.bmp]

Structure of Matter

Modern physics has revealed successively deeper layers of structure in
ordinary matter. Matter is composed, on a tiny scale, of particles
called atoms. Atoms are in turn made up of minuscule nuclei surrounded
by a cloud of particles called electrons. Nuclei are composed of
particles called protons and neutrons, which are themselves made up of
even smaller particles called quarks. Quarks are believed to be
fundamental, meaning that they cannot be broken up into smaller
particle.

PROPERTIES OF ATOMS

Atoms have several properties that help distinguish one type of atom
from another and determine how atoms change under certain conditions.
These properties include;

(i) The Atomic number: The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom
    is called its atomic number (Z). All atoms of the same element have
    the same number of protons and so have the same atomic number. Atoms
    are normally electrically neutral so the atomic number also shows
    how many electrons an atom has. However, an atom may lose or gain an
    electron to become a charged particle called an ion. When an atom
    loses an electron it forms a positively charged ion called a cation.
    When an atom gains an electron it forms a negatively charged ion
    called an anion. The number of electrons thus determines many of the
    chemical and physical properties of an atom.

(ii) The Mass number: The sum of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus
     of an atom is called the mass number of the atom (A). The number of
     neutrons is denoted by N.

  The relationship between the number of neutrons and protons is given
  by; A=Z - N

(iii) The Atomic Mass and Weight: Scientists use a device called a mass
      spectrometer to measure atomic mass. The mass of an atom is
      measured in terms of a unit called the atomic mass unit (amu). An
      amu is defined as exactly 1/12 the mass of an atom of carbon with
      six protons and six electrons.

  An element’s atomic weight represents the mass of one mole of its
  atoms. A mole is the mass of a very large number of atoms. A mole of
  atoms of any element contains 6.02 × 10²³ atoms. This is also called
  the molar mass.

(iv) Isotopes: Atoms of the same element that differ in mass number (A)
     are called isotopes. They have the same atomic number (Z). These
     elements have the same number of protons in their nucleus but
     different numbers of neutrons. For example, hydrogen has three
     isotopes ¹H; ²H; ³H called Protium, Deuterium and Tritium
     respectively.

HYDROGEN ISOTOPES

    protons and two neutrons.

2.  Briefly describe the three types of hydrogen atoms that exist.

3.  Write the (a) mass number (b) atomic number of Sodium atom.

Sub-Topic 3: Concept of Elements, Molecules, Compounds and Mixtures

ELEMENT: A substance that is made up of only one type of atoms is called
an element. An element cannot be broken down into anything else.
Examples are magnesium, copper, zinc, gold, iron, oxygen, carbon,
chlorine, etc.

MOLECULE: The smallest unit of a substance which can exist on its own
and retain the properties of the substance is called a molecule. A
molecule may be made up of one atom only e.g. Argon (Ar) or a
combination of atoms e.g. Oxygen (O₂).

COMPOUND: A substance formed by the chemical combination of the atoms of
different elements is a compound. Examples are Sodium chloride (salt),
water, kaolin, carbon (iv), oxide, sand, etc.

MIXTURE: A substance formed when elements or compounds are mixed without
any chemical reaction occurring is called a mixture. Examples are crude
oil, soil, cup of tea, air, palm oil, solution of salt and water, etc.
The components of a mixture can be separated by physical means like
evaporation, magnetization, filtration, Sublimation, etc.

CONCEPT OF THE PERIODIC TABLE

The most important classification of chemical substances is the
arrangement of the elements in the Periodic Table/Chart. A Russian
scientist called Mendeleev (1869) was the first to construct a periodic
table. He arranged elements in order of increasing relative atomic mass.
However, scientists have discovered that elements vary regularly with
their atomic number. Each element in the periodic table is represented
by a chemical symbol which makes it easy to identify them. Elements that
share a column in the table have similar properties. The first twenty
elements in the periodic table are;

1. Hydrogen

2. Helium

3. Lithium

4. Beryllium

5. Boron

6. Carbon

7. Nitrogen

8. Oxygen

9. Fluorine

10. Neon

11. Sodium

12. Magnesium

13. Aluminum

14. Silicon

15. Phosphorus

16. Sulphur

17. Chlorine

18. Argon

19. Potassium

20. Calcium

EVALUATION

1.  What is a chemical symbol?

2.  Enumerate the four groups of chemical symbols and give three
    examples of each.

3. The periodic table shows the classification of elements in what
order?

4. Mention the first twenty elements in the periodic table.

Sub-Topic 2: CHEMICAL FORMULAE AND EQUATIONS

CHEMICAL FORMULAE: A chemical formula is the representation of a
substance using symbols and numbers. A chemical formula represents a
molecule of a substance(an element or compound) and gives information
about the types of atoms present in the substance and their
number/proportion.

Every element and every compound has itsown formula e.g. the chemical
formula for one molecule of water is H₂O. This means that one molecule
of water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.

[]

Other examples are;

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Name of substance                   Chemical Formula
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Oxygen(molecule)                    O₂

  Hydrogen(molecule)                  H₂

  Carbondioxide(compound)             CO₂

  Ammonia(compound)                   NH₃

  Magnesium oxide(compound)           MgO

  Tetraoxosulphate(vi) acid(compound) H₂SO₄

  Phosphorus(molecule)                P₄
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Chemical formulae are written in a particular way to obey certain rules.
Each element in the substance is written in capital letter and its
proportion/number in the substance is written as a subscript. A
subscript applies to the symbol before it e.g. in the formula NH_(3,)
the subscript(3) refers to H(hydrogen) only.

Combining Powers (Valency) of Elements

When atoms of different elements combine during a chemical reaction, the
atom that loses electrons becomes positively charged (cation). The atoms
that gain electrons become negatively charged (anion). The number of
electrons lost or gained by an atom is it’s combining power/ valency.
This is in order to attain the nearest noble gas electronic
configuration that is, a neutral state.

Metals show positively charged combining power. Non-metals such as
chlorine have negative combining power. However, some elements exhibit
more than one type of combining power.

Examples;

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ELEMENT                 SYMBOL                  VALENCY
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  Fluorine                F                       -1

  Chlorine                Cl                      -1

  Iodine                  I                       -1

  Oxygen                  O                       -2 ,-1

  Nitrogen                N                       3 , 5

  Sodium                  Na                      1

  Calcium                 Ca                      2

  Zinc                    Zn                      2

  Copper                  Cu                      1 , 2

  Iron                    Fe                      2 , 3
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

To write the chemical formula of an ionic compound superscripts are used
for the ions, this makes the total positive charges equal the total
negative charges. For example Sodium chloride is formed from a
combination of a positively charged Sodium ion, Na⁺ and a negatively
charged Chlorine ion, Cl⁻ , thus the chemical formula of Sodium chloride
is Na⁺Cl⁻ simply written as NaCl. Other examples are;

1.  Magnesium Sulphide Mg²⁺S⁻ (MgS)

2.  Magnesium Chloride Mg²⁺Cl⁻ (MgCl)

3.  Sodium Sulphide Na⁺S²⁻(Na₂S)

4.  Aluminium Sulphide Al³⁺S²⁻ (Al₂S₃)

A group of atoms carrying either positive or negative charge is called a
radical(polyatomic ions)e.g. SO₄²⁻, OH⁻, NO₃⁻. The combining powers of
such radicals are the net number of positive or negative charges they
carry. The chemical formula for such polyatomic ions is written in
brackets and the superscript/subscript is placed outside the bracket.
Examples;

1.  Trioxonitrate (v) ion (NO₃)⁻

2.  Tetraoxosulphate (vi) ion (SO₄)²⁻

3.  Trioxocarbonate (iv) ion (CO₃)²⁻

4.  Sodium trioxonitrate (v) Na⁺NO₃⁻= NaNO3

5.  Aluminium tetraoxosulphate(vi) Al³⁺⁽SO₄)²⁻ =Al₂(SO₄)₃

CHEMICAL EQUATIONS: A chemical equation is a condensed statement of
facts about a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction takes place
whenever a substance undergoes chemical change. A chemical equation is
thus used to represent the changes in bonding and changes in energy that
take place in the reaction.

Chemical reactions involve reactants and products. The reactants are the
substances that existed before the chemical reaction took place. The
products are the substances formed as a result of the reaction. For
example, hydrogen gas reacts with oxygen gas to produce water (liquid).
This statement can be written as;

Hydrogen gas + Oxygen gas → Water

The reactants which are hydrogen gas and oxygen gas are written on the
left of the arrow while the product which is water is written on the
right of the arrow. This statement can be written with chemical formulae
thus;

H_(2 (g)) + O_(2 (g)) → H₂O _((l))

During a chemical reaction atoms may be re-arranged to form new
substances but they are never created or destroyed. The equation above
is referred to as an unbalanced equation this is because the number of
Oxygen atoms on the right is not the same as the number on the left. To
balance chemical equations coefficients are used. A coefficient is a
number written in front of a formula to balance the equation.
Coefficients indicate the smallest number of molecules of a substance
that may take part in a reaction. So to balance the equation above a
coefficient of 2 is introduced;

2 H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

The balanced equation reads, two molecules of hydrogen react with one
molecule of oxygen to produce two molecules of water. The coefficient
multiplies all the atoms in the reaction so; four atoms of Hydrogen
react with two atoms of Oxygen to produce four atoms of Hydrogen and two
atoms of Oxygen, a balanced reaction. Since the number of atoms in the
reactants equal the number of atoms in the products, the arrow may be
replaced with equality sign and written as;

TOPIC: RESOURCES FROM LIVING THINGS

CONTENT

1.  Resources from plants

2.  Resources from animals

3.  Economic importance of resources to self and society.

RESOURCES FROM LIVING THINGS

Resources are useful things or materials we derive from living things or
non-living things. These

living things are plants and animals.

Sub-Topic 1: RESOURCES FROM PLANTS

There are crops that we grow for their leaves, fruits, stems and roots.
We can identify four major types of plant resources. These are: food
crops, crops for textiles, wood crops, and medicinal plants.

Food Crops

1.  Leafy Vegetables: These are plants grown for their leaves. These are
    either cooked or eaten fresh as salads. They provide us with
    minerals (calcium and iron) and vitamins (particularly vitamins A
    and C) which our bodies need. Examples include lettuce, cabbage,
    bitter leaf, pumpkin leaf,Talinum, and other plants used for ‘leafy
    soups.

[]

2.  Fruits: Examples are peppers, tomatoes, okra, mangoes, bananas,
    pawpaw, dates, oranges, lemons, pineapples and guavas. They provide
    the body with mineral salts and vitamins.

[] [] []

[][]

3.  Seeds: Examples of seeds include beans, maize, millet, sorghum,
    rice, barley, and wheat. We eat many of them as cooked foods. They
    provide us with starch, fat, and protein. We use barley for brewing
    beer, and wheat to make flour used in baking bread and cakes. We
    also use sorghum, and maize to make some local drinks.

[]

4.  Underground Crops: These include stem tubers or swollen stems such
    as yam, cocoyam, and Irish potato; root tubers such as cassava,
    sweet potato, carrot, radish; and bulbs like onions. They are called
    underground crops because they grow under the ground. They provide
    us mainly with starch.

Cassava Yam

5.  Oil Plants: These are oil palm, groundnut, cotton, coconut, and
    olive. We produce cooking oils from their seeds or fruits. The oil
    is also used for other things like margarine, soap and body cream.

[] Oil palm Nuts (in bunches)

[]

Coconut

Crops for Textiles

These are crops that we use to make cloth, ropes, baskets, and dyes.

1.  Cloth: The fibre produced by cotton plants, found around the seeds
    is used for making cloth.

2.  Ropes: Materials for sacks and nets are made from different kinds of
    plants like sisal, sorrel plant, guinea-hemp and jute. We also
    obtain fibres from the Baobab, Bauhinia, and Greutvia.

3.  Baskets: Palm leaves provide materials for making hats, bags,
    baskets, and other things.

4.  Dyes: We obtain dyes from many plants e.g. Indigo plant, logwood,
    weld, safflower, Brazil wood, cola-nuts, etc.

[C:\Users\JAMES COMFORT O\Documents\My Received Files\Photo0042.jpg]
COTTON

Wood Crops

Some trees provide hardwood which is used for buildings and furniture,
e.g. Mahogany, Ebony, Iroko, Obeche and Camphor. Some trees provide
softwood which is used for wood pulp and paper, as well as for
buildings. Also leaves of some plants are used for roofs, fences, and
for making furniture. Palm leaves are used for roofing and fencing.

Plants provide us with firewood which is a source of energy.

Medicinal Plants

The bark, roots and leaves of some plants are used as medicines;

1.  against many diseases like fever

2.  to heal wounds

3.  to stop frequent stools

4.  to cure indigestion

Examples of such plants include; lemon grass, Neem, Aloe vera, bitter
leaf, ginger, etc.

CASH CROPS

These are crops produced mainly for sale, particularly to people in
other countries of the world. They include fibre crops, oil crops, and
some food crops.

Some very well-known cash crops are; fibre crops, such as cotton; oil
crops such as groundnuts and oil palm; wood crops such as mahogany and
ebony.

Other cash crops are rubber, coffee, tea, cola, coconut, cocoa, sugar
cane, tobacco, beni-seed, and shea-butter.

Cocoa Plant

EVALUATION

1.  List four groups of resources obtained from plants.

2.  Give three examples from each group and state their uses.

3.  Discuss four major cash crops grown in Nigeria.

Sub-Topic 2: RESOURCES FROM ANIMALS

Animals that commonly provide us with food are of three main types;

(i) Livestock Animals: This group consists of animals like cows, goats,
    sheep and pigs. They provide us with meat, milk and butter. In
    addition, they provide hides and skins which we use for leather
    goods (bags, shoes, purses, belts, drums, garments). The word ‘hide’
    refers to skin of large animals like cattle (also horses and
    camels); and ‘skin’ refers to the skin of smaller animals like
    goats, sheep, rabbits, pigs. We use animal bones and horns for
    furniture, glue, and some other things. Their faeces are used as
    manure to improve the growth of plants (food crops).

[] []

Sheep Pig

[]

Goat

(ii) Poultry Animals: This group consists of poultry birds – chicken,
     guinea fowl, duck, goose, pigeon, turkey etc. They provide us with
     meat and eggs. We also use their feathers in pillows and for
     decoration. Their droppings are used as manure on farms and garden.

[] []

Duck Turkey

[]

Geese

(iii) Aquatic Animals: The third group consists of animals that live in
      water; fish, prawns, crayfish and crabs (some crabs also live on
      land). We use them for food. They provide us with proteins,
      minerals and vitamins.

[] []

Fish Prawn

[]

Crab

Apart from providing us with food, animals also provide other useful
things already listed, animals provide glue (from their bones), wool and
fur (from their coats) and ivory (from elephants’ tusks) used in making
some kinds of furniture.

EVALUATION

1.  Enumerate three types of animals and mention the resources they
    provide for us.

2.  Mention other ways by which resources from animals can be used.

SUB-TOPIC 3: ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF RESOURCES TO SELF AND SOCIETY

Plants and animal resources are economically important to man and the
society. They are sources of;

(i) Food for man and livestock e.g. vegetables, fruits, seeds, tubers,
    meat, eggs, butter, etc.

(ii) Raw materials for industries e.g. rubber, cocoa, ginger, groundnut,
     cotton, Mahogany, etc.

(iii) Family and national income, that is from the local sale or export
      of the resources.

(iv) Manure; which help to replenish soil fertility.

(v) Fuel e.g. firewood, charcoal, biogas, etc.

(vi) Medicine e.g. Penicillin

(vii) Herbicides etc.

Plant and animal resources can also have harmful/ negative implications
on man and his environment. This could arise from;

(i) Pollution e.g. stench from refuse dumps and sewage; gases from
    burning fuels; etc.

(ii) Contamination of food or water thereby causing ill health in plants
     and animals.

(iii) Their being used as biological weapons e.g. Anthrax dust.

(iv) Over consumption of foodstuff which may cause health problems like
     obesity, bedwetting, diabetes, heart and circulatory diseases.

EVALUATION

Discuss briefly the economic importance of resources from living things
to your society.

WEEKEND ASSIGNMENT

1.  (a) Mention five plants and five animals people in your community
    make use of.

(c) In what ways do people use such plants and animals?

TOPIC: RESOURCES FROM NON-LIVING THINGS

CONTENT

1.  Soil – Formation/ Composition; Types; Uses.

2.  Solid Minerals – Examples; Importance and uses.

3.  Distribution of solid minerals in Nigeria.

SUB-TOPIC 1: FORMATION OF SOIL

Soil is formed from rocks over thousands of years through a process
known as weathering. Weathering is a chemical, physical, or biological
means of breaking down rock into the small particles that eventually
make up the soil.

Soil is composed of;

(i) The products of weathering which are inorganic in nature. They
    include stone, gravel, clay, sand, silt. In these particles are
    minerals such as magnesium, iron, phosphorus etc.

(ii) Organic materials such as dead plants and animals, parts of plants,
     and animal waste.

(iii) Water, air, and soil organisms (e.g. earthworm, termites,
      bacteria, fungi etc.).

The inorganic particles determine to a large extent the properties of
soil type.

TYPES OF SOIL

Soils are composed of a mixture of particles. These particles are sand,
silt and clay which all have varying amount of humus. Humus is formed by
the action of soil organisms on dead plants and animals as well as on
animal wastes. Humus among other functions it performs in the soil helps
the inorganic particles of the soil to stick together in crumbs.
Therefore, the amount of humus in the soil also determines the
properties of a soil type.

There are three major types of soil:

1.  Sandy soil: This consists of fine and large particles irregularly
    arranged. It has a loose structure.

2.  Loamy soil: This consists of a small amount of sand and clay
    particles combined with decaying organic matter formed from plant
    and animal tissue.

3.  Clayey soil: This is made up of very fine particles with very little
    space in between them.

Properties of Sandy Soil

(a) It is very porous.

(b) Water drains away quickly.

(c) It is coarse and easy to work (e.g. during tillage).

(d) Requires fertilizer to grow crops well.

[C:\Users\JAMES COMFORT O\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary
Internet Files\t001725c.bmp]

Sandy soil

Properties of Clayey Soil

(a) It is a fine-grained and heavy soil.

(b) Water drains away poorly. They water log easily.

(c) Difficult to work on.

(d) Hardens and cracks during dry season.

(e) Needs careful management to grow crops.

[]

Clayey soil

Properties of Loamy Soil

(a) It is a mixture of sand and clay particles.

(b) Has good crumb structure which drains well yet retains sufficient
    water for crop growth.

(c) It has plenty of nutrients and is therefore good for agricultural
    purposes.

[]

Loamy soil

USES OF SOIL

The importance of soil to man cannot be over-emphasized. Soil is used
for;

(a) Cultivating crops

(b) Grazing of animals (livestock)

(c) Building of houses

(d) Making pottery (pots, flower vases, artifacts, etc.)

(e) Serves as home for soil organisms.

(f) Provides materials for building houses.

(g) Provides surface for construction of roads, buildings and other
    activities of man

EVALUATION

1.  Mention three components of soil.

2.  Name three differences between the three main types of soil.

3.  State five uses of soil.

Sub-Topic 2: SOLID MINERALS

Solid minerals are naturally occurring chemical elements or compounds
which are found in rocks or in the soil, examples are gold, salt, tin
etc.Minerals can exist as solids or non-solids or a combination of both.
All rocks are made up of minerals. Rocks which contain a high
concentration of the mineral of a particular metal, from which it can be
profitably mined is called the ore of that metal e.g. iron ore, copper
ore, etc.

Solid minerals have been found deposited in some parts of Nigeria in
commercial quantities and they are of valuable use to man. Due to their
importance, the federal government established the Ministry of Solid
Minerals to handle all matters concerning solid minerals.

Man utilizes some of these minerals in their natural/crude form while
some of them have been combined with other materials i.e. processed to
form products which are useful to man.

There are about 34 minerals resources found in Nigeria. They include
columbite, gold, zinc, diamond, gypsum, limestone, tin, copper, etc.

Scientific study of minerals is called mineralogy and the scientist who
studies mineralogy is called a mineralogist.

Below is a table showing some mineral resources found in Nigeria, their
location and uses.

Topic: ETHICAL ISSUES IN SCIENCE AND DEVELOPMENT

CONTENT:

1. Meaning of right and wrong application of science.

2. Implications of the application of science to the development of the
society.

Introduction:

Science is the study of structure and behavior of the physical and
natural world and phenomenon through a systematic observation and
experiment. This study has opened and widened the knowledge and capacity
of man beyond his imagination.

Sub-Topic1: Meaning of Right and Wrong Applications of Science

THE RIGHT APPLICATIONS OF SCIENCE

The application of any knowledge gained from science that will directly
or

Indirectly benefit mankind is described as the right application. There
are many applications of science that have benefited mankind in all
areas of his existences. Some of these applications are in the areas of:

1. Health and medicine: Through the scientific study of human health,
science has discovered and produced drugs for the cure of many diseases.
Some of the deadly diseases that caused death of men, women and children
in the olden days like smallpox, malaria, tetanus, etc.

[]

2. Transportation: in the olden days, before the great advances in
science, people trekked from one place to another carrying heavy load on
their heads. With the invention of bicycles, cars, Lorries, ships, aero
planes, etc., transportation of goods and services has become easier,
faster and more comfortable.

[] []

OLD MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION

[] [][]

MODERN TRANSPORTATION METHODS

3. Agriculture: food is now produced in very large quantities with
minimal lab our through the use of modern farming equipment like
tractors, ridgers, combine harvesters, etc. the yield of crops per given
area has tremendously increased through the use of scientifically
improved seedlings and seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.

4. Communication: Scientific advances have greatly improved the ease and
speed of communication. Transfer of information between people separated
by wide distance is achieved through the use of telephone, GSM,
internet, etc.

[]

5. Security: as a result of scientific inventions, human lives and
properties have become more secure than in the olden days. Scientific
equipment like smoke detector, weather satellite, seismic detectors,
etc. , can give us advance warning of impending dangers like fire,
hurricane, drought, earthquake, volcanic eruptions, etc. this will
enable us act on time to stop the danger or reduce its effect. With
scientific equipment, we can defend ourselves against attacks from
dangerous animals and from fellow human beings.

Sub-Topic 2: Wrong applications of science

When science is wrongly applied, it causes problems, miseries,
destructions and even deaths. Individuals and nations should take care
on how science is applied. Its wrong application has far reaching
devastating consequences.

Wrong applications of science are:

1.  Health and medicine: the manufacture and release into the market of
    fake and substandard drugs have led to loss of many lives. Some
    medicines become poison when wrongly taken hence; many drugs carry
    the label ‘keep out of reach of children’.

2.  Transportation: Roads accidents occur due to poor maintenance of
    roads and vehicles.

air disasters also occur due to poor maintenance and ageing of
aircrafts. This mishaps lead to loss of lives and property.

3.  Agriculture: Some of the chemicals used in agriculture like
    pesticides are poisonous.

When they are washed into rivers and streams they poison the water and
destroy aquatic lives.

Sprayer

4.  Communication: through the use of internet, computer, phone, etc.
    fraud and

Pornography, terrorism, and other criminal activities are easily and
rapidly carried out.

5.  Security: mankind can be wiped off the earth at the press of a
    button. This is what

the discovery of atomic energy and manufacture of atomic brought about
by the use of

biological warfare weapons such as the release of anthrax dust into the
atmosphere. Its

effects are far reaching.

IMPLICATIONS OF SCIENCE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIETY

Science has both positive and negative implications to the development
of the society. The usefulness of science to the society and the danger
it poses depends on the person using or manipulating it and the use to
which it is put.

The results of science include chemical, biological and nuclear weapons,
which are some of the most destructive weapons that have ever been made
in the world.

    well-being of others and your physical environment? State 2
    practical things you can do personally to show that you care for the
    welfare of others.

Week 8: Light Energy

CONTENT: 1.Review of the concepts of (I) reflection (ii) refraction of
light

2. Apparent depth and its dangers to swimmers.

3. Vision

4. Dispersion and rainbow.

TOPIC: Light Energy

Light is a form of energy. It enables us to see things when it is
reflected from objects into

our eyes.

Sub-Topic1: Review of the concepts of reflection

Reflection is the sending back of rays of light after striking a
reflecting surface. Reflection from a surface depends on how smooth or
rough the surface is. A reflection from a smooth surface like a mirror
is regular while that from rough surfaces like walls and stones is
irregular or diffuse.

[]

[C:\Users\mr.augustine\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary
Internet Files\T046290A.bmp]

There are two basic laws of reflection. These are:

i.  The incident ray, the normal ray and the reflected ray at the point
    of incidence, all lie on the same plane.

ii. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection

APPLICATIONS OF REFLECTION IN SOME OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS

For example:

i.  The plane mirror is used as a dressing mirror because it shows a
    reflection of our image.

ii. The simple periscope contains two plane mirrors facing each other,
    and inclined at an angle of 45⁰ to the horizontal. It is used to
    view beyond obstacles e.g. in submarines, simple periscopes are used
    to view ships on the ocean.

iii. The sextant: this is used for finding the angle of elevation of the
     sun; it also consists of two mirrors.

iv. The kaleidoscope: This is used for producing different color patters
    when turned. It makes use of plane mirrors inclined at 60⁰ to each
    other.

Sub-Topic 2: Refraction of light

The change in direction of light as it passes from one medium to another
is known as refraction. For instance, light which bounces back from an
object that is placed underwater travels first through water and then
the air, before it gets to the eyes of the observer? At some angles, the
object partially submerged will appear to bend where it enters the
water; this is because light from that part underwater is refracted.

[]

Light always travels at different speeds through different materials,
hence it changes speed at the boundary between two materials. When a
beam of light falls on boundary at an angle, light on the side of the
beam which gets there first, is fired to speed up or slow down, after
which the light from the other side’s touches the new materials. It
makes the beam to bend or be refracted at the boundary.

Apparent Depth

The concept of apparent depth can be explained through the phenomenon of
refraction.

When a coin is dropped into a cup of water and of water and viewed
directly from above, it appears to be nearer the water surface.

The distance between the level where the coins is and the surface of the
water is the real depth; while the distance between the level where the
coin appears to be and the surface of the water is the apparent depth.
Other areas where we have apparent depth include:

i.  The depth of a swimming pool always appears shallower than it is in
    reality. This could be dangerous to a swimmer who would think that
    the pool is not deep and could get drowned if he is not a good
    swimmer.

ii. A thick glass slab e.g. a rectangular glass block, appears not to be
    as thick as it actually is, when viewed directly from above.

Sub-Topic 3: VISION

Vision is the ability to see. The eye is the organ with which we see.

[]

  The eye consists of the following parts:

i.  Eye lens: The eye lens is used for focusing light entering the eye
    onto the retina. It produces real but inverted images of objects on
    the retina.

ii. Retina: This is the light sensitive area at the back of the eye
    where inverted images are formed. The optical nerves begin at the
    retina. []

  The working of the eye

iii. Cornea: this is the tick protective transparent layer in front of
     the eye. It begins the refraction of light entering the eye.

iv. The pupil: This is a circular opening (hole) in the eye which
    permits light to enter the eye. In dim light, the opening increases
    to allow more light to enter but in bright, the opening decreases to
    reduce the amount of light entering the eye.

v.  Iris: this is the colored circular part in front of the eye lens. it
    controls or regulates the amount of light entering the eye by
    increasing or decreasing the size of the pupil.

vi. Ciliary muscles: These are attached to the eye lens and are used to
    vary its thickness and consequently its focal length. This enables
    the eye to focus objects at different distances on the retina.

vii. The optic nerves: The optic nerves transmit light impulses from the
     retina to the brain for interpretation.

viii. The aqueous humour: This is a transparent liquid between the eye
      lens and cornea. It helps in the refraction of light.

ix. The vitreous humour: This is a transparent jelly – like liquid
    between the eye lens and

  the retina. It also helps in refraction of light and in maintaining
  the shape of the eye.

DISPERSION OF LIGHT

Dispersion of light is the seperation of white light into its component
colours.

White light comprises seven different colours, these colours are Red,
Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet. It can be easily
remebered by forming an acronym with the first letter of each colour
(ROYGBIV). It is in these order it appear when separated.

[] [C:\Users\mr.augustine\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary
Internet Files\T046298A.bmp]

The seven colours of ROYGBIV are known as the spectrum of white light.
When white light travels from air or vacuum into a denser medium, the
speed of its component colors varies. This results in dispersion i.e.
separation of component colours of white light. Dispersion of white
light can be obtained by shinning a beam of white light throught a
triangular prism before a white screen.

DISPERSION AND RINBOW

When sunlight rays get into a raindrops, the light bends or refracts in
a manner to form the spectrum of colors. The red light is refracted the
least and violet light is refracted the most.All other colors fall in
between the red and violet colors thereby forming the rainbow.

TOPIC: Magnetism

CONTENTS:

i. meaning of magnet

ii. Loadstone

iii. Laws of Magnetism

iv. Magnetic poles and magnetic fields

v.  Care for magnets

Sub-Topic 1: Meaning of magnet

When a magnet is put in a container filled with office pins or needles,
by the time you bring the magnet out of the container; most of the pins
or needles would have clung to it.

It shows that a magnet can attract needles and some other materials like
cobalt, nickel, iron etc.

All the materials which can be attracted by magnet are called magnetic
materials. The ability of a magnet to attract magnetic materials is
called magnetism.

[]

A magnet

Lodestone

Lodestone also called magnetite is a black oxide of iron ore (Fe₃0₄).it
has the ability to attract small pieces of iron and other pieces of
magnetic materials. It is the original magnet,and large deposits of this
substance were first discovered in Magnesia, in Asia, from where the
name magnet was formed.

Law of magnetism

The law of magnetism states that like poles of a magnet repel each
other, while unlike poles attracts each other. []

It implies that north and south poles of a magnet attract each other
while the north pole of a magnet repels the north pole of another
magnet. Similarly, the south pole of a magnet repels the south pole of
another magnet.

Sub-Topic2: Magnetic poles and magnetic fields

If a bar magnet is tied in the middle and suspended in the air, when the
bar magnet is made to swig freely, after some time it comes to rest in
the north- south direction. If there is attraction, then the pole of the
magnet beside the north-seeking pole of the standard magnet is the
south-seeking pole.

[]

Poles of a magnet

Magnetic Field

Magnetic fieid refers to the region around a magnet where the effects of
the force due to the magnet can be felt by magnetic materials.

Magnetic materials are substances that can be attracted by magnets
e.g.iron, steel, nickel, cobalt and certain alloys of iron. Maginets do
not attract non-magnetic materials.Examples of non – magnetic materials
include: rubber, glass, wood, etc.

A magnet has the ability to attract magnetic materials to itself over a
distance with no contact between them. Therefore, the space around a
magnet where this attraction is possible is the magnetic field. The
magnet field around a magnet is made up of fild lnes.

[]

MAGNETIC FIELD

Care of magnets

1.  Magnets should not be allowed to drop from a height onto a hard
    surface. This can weaken their magnetic properties.

2.  Magnets should not be hammered. This can also weaken its quality.

3.  Heating to a high temperature removes the magnetic qualities of
    permanent magnets and spoils the steel.

4.  Magnets should be stored away properly after use.

1. (a) Describe the lodestone.

(b) Mention any 2 qualities of lodestone.

2. (a) What is magnetic force?

(b) State the law of magnetism.
