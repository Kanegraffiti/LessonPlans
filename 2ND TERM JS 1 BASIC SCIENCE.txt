  -Sources of clean water

  -Water treatment processes

  -Immunization against human diseases

Sub-topic 1

Water borne diseases

Diseases caused by unclean (dirty) water are called water borne
diseases. The following are some of the water borne diseases.

(1) CHOLERA: It is caused by harmful bacteria that inflame the intestine
    and cause extreme diarrhea. Cholera is the most common diseases that
    can be contacted by drinking unclean water.

  The symptom of cholera is frequent stooling with vomiting which lead
  to dehydration. Cholera can be prevented by boiling water before
  drinking.

  2. DYSENTRY: It can be caused by a one-celled animal called

  Amoeba or by certain bacteria.

  3. DIARRHOEA: the symptom of diarrhea is frequent stooling which leads
  to dehydration, abdominal pains, bloating of the belly, feverish
  conditions and cramps. To prevent diarrhea, the food we eat and our
  drinking water should be hygienic.

  4. TYPHOID: It is caused by bacteria called salmolena typhi. Symptoms
  of typhoid fever manifest within three weeks of infection.

Symptoms include feeling cold, serious headache, running stomach,

  Constipation, enlarged liver and spleen and high fever. Typhoid fever
  could be prevented by boiling water before drinking, hygienic handling
  of food and being immunized against the diseases.

Sources of clean water.

1 Pipe-borne water

2 Spring water.

3 Rain water

4 Deep well water

Evaluation

Mention three borne diseases.

List the sources of clean water.

Sub-topic: 2: Water treatment processes

FILTERATION: - This is the process of removing impurities i.e. mud,
soil, leaves from water. Filter paper is used in the laboratory while
filter beds are used at water co-operations.

CHLORINATION: - Chlorine gas is added to water to kill bacteria. It is
harmless to human beings. It is also used to purify the water in
swimming pools.

DISTILLATION: - This is a process of obtaining pure water from impure
water by using an apparatus called Lie Bib Condenser.

DESALINATION: - This is the process of taking away salt from sea water.

FLOCCULATION: This is the dissolution and stirring of alum in water to
make tiny solid particles suspended in water to stick together
(flocculate).

Advantages of using pipe-borne water

1. It is clean and colourless.

2. It is odourless.

3. it is tasteless.

4. It is conveniently available in the home.

5. It is treated to kill disease-causing living organisms.

6. Suspended matter has been removed.

Sub-Topic 3

IMMUNIZATION

Immunization is a method of stimulating resistance against specific
diseasesin the human body using microorganisms (bacteria or viruses)
that have been modified or killed. It is also called vaccination or
inoculation. The system in the body that keeps disease-causing organisms
from entering our body is called Immune system. Immunization of the
child begins during pregnancy. The deadly diseases that require
immunization are Polio, chickenpox, Pneumonia, measles, whooping cough,
hepatitis, malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, tetanus diphtheria etc.

Sub-Topic 1: Definition of STI’s HIV\AIDS.STI’S means sexually
transmitted infections. These are diseases that can be contracted
through sexual activities. Examples include gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes,
Chlamydia, Candida infections and HIV and AIDS.

HIV-AIDS

Aids is a very dangerous disease. The full meaning of AIDS is Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome. An aid is caused by a virus called Human
Immune deficiency Virus (HIV). HIV-AIDS has no cure yet. Human body has
an Immune defense system which protects our bodies against attacks from
diseases. The virus (HIV) damages this Immune defense system.

When the virus is in the body; it is said to be HIV positive and that is
what develops to HIV-AIDS. When this happens, the person’s body will not
be able to fight any other diseases (such as fever, cough, tuberculosis,
pneumonia etc) that attack person. The person will die after some time.
HIV-AIDS can affect anybody no matter the age.

Safe age for reproduction:

The safe age for reproduction is when somebody is fully matured and
ready to take responsibilities. You have to answer the following
questions:

Topic: Description of Eclipse, climate and seasons.

Content: 1. Eclipse

2 Climate and the Seasons.

Sub-Topic 1: Eclipse

Sun is a large luminous body from which light shines on to the earth and
the moon. Because of the movement of the earth and the moon, it is
possible for one to shield (Eclipse) the other from the sun.

There are three types of eclipse:

1. An eclipse of the moon: this is formed when the earth comes between
the sun and the moon; the moon is in the shadow of the earth.

2. An eclipse of the sun: This is formed when the moon passes between
the earth and the sun, the shadow of the moon falls on parts of the
earth.

3. Annular eclipse: A times when the moon is so far away from the earth
that no region of total shadow falls on the earth. The moon is then
observed against the circular sun.

WEEK 7

Date…………………

TOPIC: CLASSIFICATION OF MATTER

CONTENT 1: States of matter

State of Matter:

Matter can be classified into the following group:

I.  Living and non-living things

II. Using state of matter

III. Using physical criteria like size, weight, texture, shape, color,
     smell, taste.

There are three states of matter which are solid, liquid and gas.

SOLID:

The particles of solid are arranged in an orderly manner. A strong
intermolecular force holds the particles together. The particles are
very much close together. Solids have definite shapes, volume and fixed
mass. Examples of solid are salt, sugar, ice-block; stone e.t.c. solid
undergoes translational motion and oscillatory motion.

LIQUID:

The particles of a liquid are not very close together. Liquid particles
are a bit free to move about because of the moderate intermolecular
force between particles. Liquid does not have a definite shape but takes
the shape of the container. Liquid are fluid which flows or diffuse in
all directions. Examples are water, blood, ink, urine. Liquid have
definite volume, fixed mass. Liquid cannot be compressed or squeezed
into a smaller space. Liquids undergo three kinds of motion, vibration,
rotational and translational.

GAS:

The particles of gas are very far apart because of the very weak
intermolecular force holding the particles. They move about freely at
great speed. Gases have no definite shape, volume but have fixed mass.
Gases can be compressed. Examples of gases are air, ammonia, steam,
oxygen e.t.c.

Change of state

When solid water [ice] is heated, its particles move faster and break
away from the ordered arrangement. The solid melts to become a liquid.
The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which solid
changes to liquid. The boiling point of a substance is the temperature
at which liquid changes to gas.

The characteristics of living things are as follows: MR NIGERCLAD

1.  Movement: Movement is a change in position .Animals move from place
    to place. Plant only moves towards the light.

2.  Respiration :This is the release of energy as a result of breakdown
    of food in the body

3.  Nutrition/Feeding: Food is a substance which when taken provides
    energy or materials for building the body. Plant and animals feed in
    order to get energy to carry out their daily activities and also to
    grow.

4.  Growth: Growth is the increase in size as a result of formation of
    new cells and increase of the new cells .All living things grow as
    they become older.

    in the environment. All living things respond to changes in the
    environment.

6.  Reproduction: all living things can reproduce their own
    kind/species.

7.  Excretion: the removal of metabolic waste products from the body is
    called excretion

8.  Adaptation: This is the way living things get used to their various
    environments.

9.  Competition: This is the ability of living things to struggle for
    all the necessities of life in order to survive in their various
    environments. Plants and animals compete for food.

  10. Life span/ Death: All living things must die because they have
  limited period of existence.

Sub-Topic 2: Uses/Importance of plants and animals.

Plants and animals can be used for the following purposes.

Uses of plants

1. Plants provides food such as vegetables, fruits, tuber, leaves etc
for man and animals’

WEEK 1O

Date……………..

TOPIC: Activities of living things

CONTENT: 1. Types e.g. movement; feeding, reproduction etc.

  2. .Associated organs;

  3. Purpose/importance of the activities.

Sub-Topic 1: Movement

Types of movement

[i]Active movement: This occurs when a living thing moves by its own
energy

[ii] Passive movement: This occurs when a living thing is carried by
wind or water or animals from one place to another.

[iii] Bending movement: This occurs in plants which bend towards light,
water or gravity.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Method of movement       Animals                    Organ
  ------------------------ -------------------------- --------------------
  Jumping                  Frog, toad, monkey,        Fore and hind limbs

  Walking                  Man, leopard, lion.        Legs,

  Crawling                 Snake, lizard, crocodile   Belly ,fore and hind

                                                      limbs
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose of movement

[i] To search for food.

[i] To escape from dangers and enemies.

[iii] To respond to changes in the environment.

[iv] To seek reproductive mates or sites

Types of movement in plants are phototropism; movement towards light.
Geotropism is the movement towards gravity.

Mode of feeding:

1. Authotrophic mode of feeding: This is found in green plants .Light
energy is trapped by green plants and combined with inorganic materials
(CO₂) to produce food.eg photosynthesis.

2. Heterotrophic mode of feeding: This is found mainly in animals .They
are unable to produce their own food hence depends on already
manufactured solid food which must be digested and absorbed. Under this
mode of feeding, organisms (animals) can be classified according to
their feeding habits.

A] Herbivorous: These are the animals that feed mainly on plants. These
are called ruminants. Examples are goats sheep and cattle.

B] Carnivorous animals: These are animals that feed mainly on flesh.
Examples are lion, cat and tiger.

C] Omnivorous animals: These are animals that can feed on both plants
and animals materials e. g man.

Sub-topic 2

Reproduction

Types of reproduction:

1.  Asexual reproduction:

2.  Sexual reproduction.

[a] In plant

a.  Sexual reproduction: This is the reproduction of plant through
    seeds.

b.  Asexual reproduction: This is the process by which plant reproduces
    itself through vegetative means. This method includes cutting,
    layering, budding and grafting.

[b] Animal

  Sexual reproduction: This is the fusion of male and female
  reproductive organs together .It is the only means of reproduction in
  animals.

Types of growth:

1. Apical is the growth that involves growing tip of plant, growing tall
from time to time.

2. Intercalary is a type of growth that involves every part of the body
growing at the same time.

Types of respiration

1. Aerobic respiration oxygen is used to liberate energy.

Anaerobic respiration involves a chemical process common with organisms
like bacteria.

Evaluation:

1. In a tabular form highlight the types of movement in animals.

2. Explain the two types of growth in living things

  Excretion                           Skin, kidney, stomach, lenticels

  Reproduction                        Male and female reproductive
                                      organs, Flowers, buds.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose/importance of the activities

Movement: It enables plants and animal to search for food. It enables
animals to change position.

Respiration: (Wastes product) carbon (IV) oxide gets rid of the body
systems.

Nutrition: this enables plants and animals to get energy for their daily
activities. This enables plant and animal to grow.

Irritability: it enables plants and animals to be sensitive to changes
in their environment.

Growth: The food eaten is used to increase size and weight of plants and
animals.

Excretion: All the wastes product are eliminated from the body system
during excretion.

Reproduction: Plants and animals are able to bring forth young ones like
themselves. This brings about increase in population .It is for
continuity of life.

Evaluation:

1.  How many types of movement do you know in plant?

2.  Mention the importance of the activities in living things.

Reading Assignment:

Read Stan pages 104-108.

Weekend assignment:

1. Mention the activities of living things.

2. State the purpose of the activities mentioned above.
