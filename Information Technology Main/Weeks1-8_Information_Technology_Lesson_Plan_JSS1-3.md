- **Entry Behaviour:** Students are aware of computer viruses and basic prevention methods from previous lessons.
- **Behavioural Objectives:** By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
  1. Explain how antivirus software detects and removes computer viruses.
  2. Identify common signs that a computer might be infected with a virus.
  3. Perform basic antivirus tasks such as updating virus definitions, running scans, and reviewing scan reports (demonstration or simulation).
  4. Outline safe computing practices that enhance virus detection and prevention.
  5. Develop a personal checklist for maintaining virus-free devices at school and at home.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher narrates a short story of a school computer infected with a virus and asks students to suggest how the issue could be discovered and fixed.

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher explains the concept of antivirus software, virus definitions, signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and real-time protection.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher demonstrates how to update antivirus definitions, run quick and full scans, quarantine threats, and view scan logs, highlighting the importance of regular updates.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups using screenshots or simulations to practise selecting the correct antivirus task, interpret scan results, and compile safe computing tips (regular updates, avoiding suspicious downloads, using strong passwords, backing up data).

**Step 5 – Evaluation:** Teacher assesses understanding by asking students to list steps for running an antivirus scan, explain the purpose of updates, and describe actions to take when a virus is detected.

### Content Summary

1. **Antivirus software** detects, prevents, and removes viruses using **virus definitions**, **heuristic analysis**, and **real-time scanning**.
2. Signs of infection include **slow performance**, **unexpected pop-ups**, **files disappearing**, and **system crashes**.
3. Regularly updating antivirus software and performing scheduled scans keep computers protected.
4. Safe practices—such as **avoiding suspicious links**, **using trusted storage devices**, and **backing up data**—support virus detection and prevention.

### Conclusion

Teacher highlights that proactive virus detection protects data, hardware, and user privacy, and encourages students to apply safe computing habits daily.

### Student Lesson Notes

- Antivirus software uses **updates and scans** to identify and remove viruses from computers.
- We should **update antivirus definitions**, **run regular scans**, and **check scan reports** to keep systems safe.
- Safe computing habits like **avoiding unknown downloads** and **backing up files** help prevent infections.
- Create a quick summary in your notebook highlighting the key terms, diagrams, and examples from this lesson.
- Teach a friend or family member what you learned to check your understanding and build confidence.


### Assignment

Create a weekly antivirus maintenance schedule that includes update times, scan types, and safety checks for a school computer laboratory.
