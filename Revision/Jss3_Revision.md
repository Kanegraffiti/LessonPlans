# JSS3 Revision Summary (Weeks 1–10 Focus)

## Basic Science
- **Family Traits:** Physical or behavioural features passed from parents to children (e.g., eye colour, dimples).
- **Dominant vs Recessive:** Dominant traits appear when inherited from one parent (free earlobes, dimples), while recessive traits show only when received from both parents (attached earlobes, straight hairline). Genes carry instructions for these traits.

## Basic Technology
- **Timber Defects:** Knots (from branches), warping, splits, and insect holes reduce strength and appearance.
- **Timber Treatment:** Preservatives and proper seasoning protect wood from decay and pests; presentation methods like plain/flat sawing or quarter sawing affect board strength and grain.
- **Seasoning:** Air seasoning stacks boards to reduce moisture gradually; kiln drying speeds up moisture removal in a controlled chamber.

## Information Technology
- **Computer Career Opportunities:** Roles include system analysts (study user needs), software developers/programmers (design and code applications), network engineers (set up and maintain communication systems), database administrators (secure and manage data), and computer technicians (maintain hardware).
- **Key Responsibilities:** Understand which professional plans projects, who codes software, and who maintains networks or databases.

## Exam Readiness Tips
- Use a family trait chart to classify examples as dominant or recessive.
- Link each timber defect to a matching treatment or prevention method.
- Match computer professionals to their primary duties and tools they use.
- Practise explaining why seasoning timber before use prevents warping and decay.
