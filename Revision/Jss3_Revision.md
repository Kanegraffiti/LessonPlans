# JSS3 Revision Summary (Weeks 1–10 Focus)

## Basic Science
- **Family Traits & Genetics:** Differentiate dominant vs. recessive traits (e.g., dimples vs. straight hairline) and identify inheritance tools such as pedigree charts. Know female sex chromosomes (XX) and what makes up a genome.
- **Health & Growth:** Physical fitness is the ability to work without undue fatigue; proteins repair tissues and balanced diets fuel adolescent growth. Recognize sickle cell anaemia as an inherited disease.
- **Sports Facts:** Hockey team size (11 players) and standard pitch dimensions (91.44 by 54.86 m) appear directly in objectives.

## Basic Technology
- **Timber Processing:** Reasons for treating timber (prevent decay), seasoning methods (air vs. kiln), and defects like knots or blue stain. Protect furniture with varnish or paint to block moisture.
- **Athletics & Equipment:** Javelin basics (run-off), throwing events, and pole-vault equipment (crossbar). Safe throws must land within the throwing sector.
- **Heat Treatment & Networking:** Annealing softens metal. Know the modem’s role converting signals and routers forwarding data between networks.

## Information Technology
- **Networking Devices:** Hubs repeat signals to all ports; switches reduce collisions; routers forward packets; servers provide shared resources. Ethernet cables are common wired links.
- **Addresses & Security:** IP addresses identify devices; strong Wi-Fi passwords and firewalls protect networks. Wireless adapters connect computers to Wi-Fi.
- **Digital Etiquette:** Polite language online, avoiding password sharing, and using topology diagrams to show how devices interconnect.

## Physical and Health Education (PHE)
- **Athletics & Games:** Recall javelin and pole-vault terms, list throwing events, and review famous Nigerian football heroes (Kanu Nwankwo, Rashidi Yekini).
- **Sportsmanship:** Heroes are celebrated for making the nation proud. Connect measurements and rules (throwing sector, pitch size) to practical scenarios.
- **Multievent Knowledge:** Definitions of decathlon, pentathlon, and heptathlon, plus examples of track and field events in the decathlon.

## Exam Readiness Tips
- Use Punnett-square style thinking to contrast dominant and recessive traits with real human examples.
- Sketch a simple timber workflow—from seasoning to protection—and match each defect with a prevention step.
- Build a small network diagram labelling modem, router, switch, and clients; include one security practice like changing default admin passwords.
- For PHE, rehearse throwing-event equipment, Nigerian sports heroes, and multievent meanings to tackle both multiple-choice and theory items.
