# JSS1 Revision Summary (Weeks 1–10 Focus)

## Basic Science
- **Sanitation:** Keeping surroundings clean to stop germs; daily actions include sweeping, mopping, clearing drains, and covering refuse bins. Good sanitation prevents diseases like malaria and keeps learning spaces comfortable. 
- **Family Health – Nutrition:** Balanced diet gives energy (carbohydrates), body building (proteins), and protection (vitamins, minerals). Encourage varied meals and clean water to stay healthy.

## Basic Technology
- **Meaning of Technology:** Use of knowledge, tools, and skills to solve problems and make work easier.
- **Branches of Technology:** Communication (phones, radio), Transportation (cars, bicycles), Construction (building tools and materials), Production/Manufacturing (factory machines), and Information Technology (computers, internet).
- **Importance:** Saves time, improves communication, boosts agriculture and housing, and creates jobs. Know common tools for each branch.

## Information Technology
- **Historical Development of Computers:** Early counting relied on fingers, stones, and tally sticks before devices like **abacus** and **Napier's bones** improved accuracy.
- **Key Ideas:** Abacus beads slide for quick addition; tally sticks record scores; need for accurate counting led to mechanical and electronic computers.

## Exam Readiness Tips
- Link each sanitation method to the health problem it prevents.
- Match food classes to examples and their functions in the body.
- Connect each branch of technology to two tools or devices you see daily.
- Practise arranging early counting devices in chronological order and state one use for each.
