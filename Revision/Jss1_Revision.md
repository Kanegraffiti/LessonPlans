# JSS1 Revision Summary (Weeks 1–10 Focus)

## Basic Science
- **Sanitation & Safety:** Daily sweeping, mopping, and proper refuse disposal prevent breeding of pests and water-borne diseases like typhoid. Handle chemicals only after reading labels and store them out of children's reach.
- **Food & Nutrition:** Connect food classes to functions—carbohydrates for energy, proteins for growth/repair, vitamins and minerals for protection. Match foods such as beans (protein) and oranges (vitamins) to each class.
- **Fitness & Health:** Core fitness ideas include endurance for long-distance running, flexibility for joint movement, and correct lifting by bending the knees with a straight back.

## Basic Technology
- **Meaning & Branches of Technology:** Technology applies knowledge, tools, and skills to solve problems. Know communication, transportation, construction, production/manufacturing, and information technology with one everyday example each.
- **Workshop Safety & First Aid:** Purpose of first aid, standard box items (antiseptic, scissors, cotton wool), and safe practices like wearing aprons and goggles. Identify simple machines (lever/seesaw) and measuring tools (try square) for practical questions.
- **Counting Tools & Materials:** Early counting methods (tally sticks, abacus) and why accurate counting led to mechanical/electronic computers. Common insulation material is plastic; hand tools include planes/files for smoothing wood.

## Information Technology
- **Hardware Basics:** Distinguish input (keyboard, mouse), output (monitor, printer), storage (flash drives), and power/surge protection. Computers process data into meaningful information.
- **Software & Shortcuts:** Operating system manages hardware; application software like word processors performs tasks. Practise shortcuts such as Ctrl+C (copy) and Ctrl+V (paste) for editing.
- **Digital Habits:** Cloud storage enables access across devices, and strong passwords mix letters, numbers, and symbols. Breaks and correct seating reduce eye strain.

## Physical and Health Education (PHE)
- **Recreation & Dance:** Indoor/outdoor games (chess, camping) and folk dances such as Bata (Yoruba) and Atilogwu (Igbo). Recreation improves relaxation and cultural awareness.
- **Fitness Skills:** Strength work (weightlifting), rhythmic activities (marching), and flexibility for healthy joints. Safe lifting prevents injury and supports endurance.
- **Outdoor Activities:** Camping and hiking vocabulary; identify which activities build endurance versus play for fun.

## Exam Readiness Tips
- Link each sanitation method to the disease it prevents and each food class to sample meals.
- Pair every branch of technology or tool with a matching real-life use (e.g., try square for right angles).
- Map counting devices in chronological order and state one limitation for each.
- Remember PHE movement terms—rhythmic activities, common dances, and safe body mechanics—because they appear in both objectives and theory prompts.
