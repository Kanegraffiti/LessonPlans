# JSS2 Revision Summary (Weeks 1–10 Focus)

## Basic Science
- **Habitat and Adaptation:** Habitat is the natural home of an organism where it gets food, water, shelter, and mates. Examples include forest, desert, freshwater, marine, and arboreal (trees).
- **Adaptation Examples:** Camels store fat in humps for deserts; ducks have webbed feet for swimming; cactus spines reduce water loss; fish use gills to breathe in water.

## Basic Technology
- **First Aid Meaning:** Immediate and temporary care for a sick or injured person before full medical treatment.
- **First Aid Box Contents:** Bandages, plasters, antiseptic solution, cotton wool, scissors, safety pins, gloves, thermometer, triangular bandage. Know each item’s use, e.g., bandages cover wounds, antiseptic cleans, cotton wool pads injuries.
- **Good Practice:** Stay calm, protect yourself with gloves, stop bleeding with pressure, and call for help.

## Information Technology
- **Computer Software:** Software is the set of programs/instructions that tell hardware what to do.
- **Types of Software:** System software (operating systems, utilities, language translators) controls hardware; application software (word processors, browsers, games) helps users perform specific tasks.
- **Hardware vs Software:** Hardware is the physical part; software is intangible but essential for operation.

## Exam Readiness Tips
- Classify organisms by habitat and list one adaptation for each.
- Rehearse packing a first aid box and stating the function of at least five items.
- Differentiate system software from application software with two examples of each.
- Practise quick responses to first aid scenarios while keeping personal safety first.
