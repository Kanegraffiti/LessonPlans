# JSS2 Revision Summary (Weeks 1–10 Focus)

## Basic Science
- **Habitats & Adaptations:** A habitat supplies food, water, shelter, and mates. Match freshwater gills, cactus spines, and desert survival to the correct environments.
- **Balanced Environment:** Understand how population-resource balance keeps ecosystems stable; list protective actions such as afforestation and recycling.
- **Soil & Water Cycles:** Causes of soil erosion (bush burning, overgrazing) and plant transpiration adding moisture to air. Nitrogen is the largest clean-air component.

## Basic Technology
- **First Aid Essentials:** Define first aid and list core items (scissors, cotton wool). Outline steps for treating minor cuts and why workshops need clear safety rules.
- **Maintenance & Materials:** Basic care for furniture (tighten screws, keep dry) and tools for fastening or drawing (screwdriver, border lines with thick dark pencils). Identify non-ferrous metals like aluminium.
- **Workshop Safety:** Keep tools arranged, floors dry, pass sharp tools handle-first, and choose correct fasteners (rivets for thin metals). Lubrication reduces friction and wear.

## Information Technology
- **Software & Hardware:** Differentiate system software vs. application software; monitors show output, flash drives carry files, and mice control on-screen pointers.
- **Care & Safety:** Keep liquids away from devices, clean vents/keyboards, and back up files. Network benefits include sharing printers and files.
- **Digital Etiquette:** Email CC sends copies, strong passwords mix varied characters, modems convert signals, and Ctrl+V pastes copied text.

## Physical and Health Education (PHE)
- **Posture & Fitness:** Upright posture prevents backache; components of fitness include speed, flexibility, and accuracy. Good posture builds confidence and balance.
- **Human Trafficking Awareness:** Poverty drives trafficking; victims face forced labour or prostitution. Prevention strategies belong in theory answers.
- **Recreation & Culture:** Recognize computer games (PlayStation), musicians like Dr Victor Uwaifo, and habits that support good posture (proper body carriage).

## Exam Readiness Tips
- Pair each habitat with a correct adaptation and one human action that protects or harms it.
- Rehearse first aid steps and workshop rules that keep classmates safe during practicals.
- Match IT hardware/software to their functions and practise key shortcuts and safety add-ons (antivirus, modems, strong passwords).
- In PHE, list causes/types of postural defects and prevention tactics for trafficking; link examples to daily school life.
