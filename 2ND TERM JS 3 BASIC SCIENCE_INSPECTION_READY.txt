Topic: Atomic Structure
Subtopic: Concept of atom and sub-atomic particles
Reference Materials:
- NERDC Basic Science Curriculum for Upper Basic Education (JSS3)
- State Scheme of Work for Second Term Basic Science
- Approved Basic Science textbooks for Junior Secondary Schools
Instructional Materials:
- Atom model/chart
- Flash cards of proton, neutron, electron
- Whiteboard and marker
- Improvised model materials (balls/wires)
Previous Knowledge:
- Learners have learnt that matter is made up of tiny particles.
Entry Behaviour:
- Learners can mention that all substances are made of particles.
Behavioural Objectives:
By the end of the lesson, learners should be able to:
- define atom.
- identify the three major sub-atomic particles.
- state charges and relative masses of sub-atomic particles.
- describe basic arrangement of particles in an atom.
- explain why atom is electrically neutral.
Lesson Presentations:
Step 1: Introduction/Set Induction
- Teacher asks learners what makes up matter.
- Teacher shows simple atom model and invites observations.
Step 2: Presentation/Teaching Steps
- Teacher defines atom as the smallest unit of an element that retains chemical properties.
- Teacher introduces proton, neutron, and electron.
- Teacher explains nucleus and electron shells.
- Teacher discusses electric neutrality in atoms.
Step 3: Learners’ Activities
- Learners label an atom diagram on chart.
- Learners complete a table of particle, charge, and location.
- Learners answer guided oral questions.
Step 4: Summary/Board Summary
- Meaning of atom.
- Sub-atomic particles and properties.
- Arrangement in the atom.
Lesson Content:
Atom
- Atom is the smallest unit of matter/element that can take part in chemical reactions.

Sub-atomic Particles
- Proton: positive charge (+1), found in nucleus.
- Neutron: no charge (0), found in nucleus.
- Electron: negative charge (-1), moves around nucleus.

Structure of Atom
- Nucleus contains protons and neutrons.
- Electrons occupy shells around nucleus.
- In a neutral atom, number of protons equals number of electrons.
Evaluation:
1. Define atom.
2. List three sub-atomic particles.
3. State the charge on electron.
4. Where are protons found?
5. Why is an atom neutral?
6. Draw and label a simple atom.
Conclusion:
- Teacher summarizes that understanding atom is the foundation for learning chemistry and materials science.
Assignment:
1. Write and explain the properties of proton, neutron, and electron.
2. Draw and label a simple atomic structure.
3. State three reasons why knowledge of atomic structure is important.

Class: JSS3 (Basic 9)
Duration: 40 minutes
Period: 2nd Period
Subject: Basic Science
Topic: Atomic Structure
Subtopic: Atomic number, mass number, and simple electronic configuration
Reference Materials:
- NERDC Basic Science Curriculum for Upper Basic Education (JSS3)
- State Scheme of Work for Second Term Basic Science
- Approved Basic Science textbooks for Junior Secondary Schools
Instructional Materials:
- Periodic table chart
- Board illustrations of electron shells
- Flash cards with sample elements (H, C, O, Na)
- Whiteboard and marker
Previous Knowledge:
- Learners can identify sub-atomic particles and their charges.
Entry Behaviour:
- Learners can count protons and electrons from simple examples.
Behavioural Objectives:
By the end of the lesson, learners should be able to:
- define atomic number and mass number.
- calculate number of neutrons from atomic data.
- write simple electronic configurations for first 20 elements (introductory level).
- relate atomic number to proton and electron numbers.
- solve basic atom-related numerical questions.
Lesson Presentations:
Step 1: Introduction/Set Induction
- Teacher revises previous contact with short questions.
- Teacher presents symbol notation example and asks what numbers represent.
Step 2: Presentation/Teaching Steps
- Teacher defines atomic number as number of protons.
- Teacher defines mass number as protons + neutrons.
- Teacher demonstrates neutron calculation: mass number minus atomic number.
- Teacher introduces shell filling pattern for simple elements.
Step 3: Learners’ Activities
- Learners solve guided examples from board.
- Learners write electronic configurations for selected elements.
- Learners peer-check answers in pairs.
Step 4: Summary/Board Summary
- Definitions of atomic number and mass number.
- Formula for neutrons.
- Simple shell configurations.
Lesson Content:
Atomic Number (Z)
- Number of protons in an atom.
- Equals number of electrons in a neutral atom.

Mass Number (A)
- Total number of protons and neutrons.
- A = protons + neutrons.

Finding Neutron Number
- Neutrons = Mass number - Atomic number.

Simple Electronic Configuration
- Electrons are arranged in shells.
- Example: Sodium (11): 2, 8, 1.
- Example: Oxygen (8): 2, 6.
Evaluation:
1. Define atomic number.
2. Define mass number.
3. Calculate neutrons if atomic number is 12 and mass number is 24.
4. Write electronic configuration of oxygen.
5. If an atom has 17 protons, how many electrons does a neutral atom have?
6. Differentiate between atomic number and mass number.
7. Solve: A = 39, Z = 19. Find neutrons.
Conclusion:
- Teacher concludes that atomic number and mass number help us describe and compare elements accurately.
Assignment:
1. Write and explain atomic number and mass number with examples.
2. Draw and label shell arrangement for sodium and magnesium.
3. Solve five atom number problems from class notes.
4. Explain why electronic configuration is useful in chemistry.
