## BECE Standards Compliance (Weeks 1–8)

- **Curriculum Alignment:** Content follows the NERDC Basic Technology curriculum and NECO BECE scheme of work for JSS 1–3, ensuring coverage of required themes (technology, safety, materials processing, drawing, energy, and maintenance).
- **SMART Lesson Objectives:** Objectives specify observable actions (define, list, draw, classify, demonstrate) that match BECE cognitive levels and skills.
- **Inclusive & Differentiated Pedagogy:** Group tasks, peer tutoring, and scaffolded notes support mixed-ability learners, including SEN students, while extension challenges stretch high achievers without gender or cultural bias.
- **Literacy, Numeracy & Graphic Skills:** Activities include labelled diagrams, scale awareness, measurement, and technical vocabulary practice to reinforce BECE paper requirements.
- **Assessment & Continuous Evaluation:** Each lesson embeds entry behaviour checks, formative questioning, classwork/practical tasks, and end-of-lesson evaluations. Teachers should document scores for continuous assessment and set at least one BECE-style objective/structured item per lesson.
- **Workshop Safety & Ethics:** All practicals (first aid, timber treatment, tools handling) must enforce safety rules, PPE use, tool accountability, and first-aid readiness while modelling environmental responsibility and anti-bullying norms.
- **ICT & 21st-Century Skills:** Encourage appropriate use of digital simulations or videos, collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving linked to local community technology needs.

### Lesson Presentation

**Step 1 – Introduction:** Teacher displays assorted items and asks students to group them by material type (rubber, plastic, ceramic, glass).

**Step 2 – Presentation:** Teacher reviews the properties of each material: elasticity of rubber, versatility of plastics, hardness of ceramics, transparency of glass.

**Step 3 – Explanation:** Teacher discusses common uses—rubber (tyres, seals, footwear), plastics (containers, packaging, furniture), ceramics (plates, tiles, electrical insulators), glass (windows, laboratory apparatus, bottles)—highlighting why each material suits its uses.

**Step 4 – Application:** Students work in groups to match products to appropriate materials, evaluate advantages and disadvantages, and present findings using comparison charts.

### Student Lesson Notes

- **Material properties** determine how and why we select a substance for a particular job or product.
- Rubber is **elastic**, plastics are **light and mouldable**, ceramics are **hard and heat-resistant**, and glass is **transparent**, so each material solves different design problems.
- We choose materials by considering the job the product will do and the environment where it will be used, such as heat, moisture, or heavy loads.
- Create a quick summary in your notebook highlighting the key terms, diagrams, and examples from this lesson so you can revisit them when designing or repairing objects.
- Teach a friend or family member what you learned to check your understanding and build confidence, using simple household examples to make the ideas clear.

- Create a study box in your notebook for **Material properties** with clear definitions, labelled sketches, and two everyday examples so you can explain it without looking at the textbook.
- Add a short checklist that reminds you how to apply **Material properties** in class activities, projects, or safety routines, noting common mistakes to avoid.

### Assignment

Prepare a table listing four household items made from each material (rubber, plastic, ceramic, glass) and explain why the material is suitable for each item.
