Lesson Presentations:
Step 1: Introduction/Set Induction
- Teacher displays two containers of water (clean and dirty) and asks learners which one is safe for drinking.
- Teacher links responses to the need for disease prevention.
Step 2: Presentation/Teaching Steps
- Teacher explains the meaning of water-borne diseases.
- Teacher discusses cholera, dysentery, diarrhoea, and typhoid with causes and symptoms.
- Teacher guides learners to identify safe sources of water: pipe-borne water, deep well water, rain water, and spring water.
- Teacher explains preventive measures: boiling water, proper storage, and hygienic food handling.
Step 3: Learners’ Activities
- Learners mention diseases they know that are linked to dirty water.
- Learners work in pairs to classify water sources as safe/unsafe.
- Learners copy key points and ask questions.
Step 4: Summary/Board Summary
- Meaning of water-borne diseases.
- Examples: cholera, dysentery, diarrhoea, typhoid.
- Sources of clean water.
- Basic preventive measures.
Lesson Content:
Meaning of Water-borne Diseases
- Water-borne diseases are diseases spread through contaminated water.

Examples and Symptoms
- Cholera: severe stooling, vomiting, dehydration.
- Dysentery: stool with blood/mucus, stomach pain.
- Diarrhoea: frequent watery stooling, weakness.
- Typhoid: fever, headache, abdominal discomfort.

Sources of Clean Water
- Pipe-borne water.
- Deep well water.
- Rain water collected hygienically.
- Spring water from protected source.

Prevention of Water-borne Diseases
- Boil drinking water.
- Store water in clean, covered containers.
- Wash hands before eating and after toilet use.
- Keep food and surroundings clean.
Evaluation:
1. Define water-borne disease.
2. List four water-borne diseases.
3. State two symptoms of cholera.
4. Mention four sources of clean water.
5. Explain two ways of preventing typhoid.
6. Why should drinking water be boiled?
Conclusion:
- Teacher reinforces that safe water and hygiene prevent many common diseases.
Assignment:
1. Write and explain five ways to keep household drinking water safe.
2. List four water-borne diseases and one symptom for each.
3. Draw and label two safe methods of storing drinking water.

Class: JSS1 (Basic 7)
Duration: 40 minutes
Period: 2nd Period
Subject: Basic Science
Topic: Disease Prevention
Subtopic: Water treatment processes and immunization
Reference Materials:
- NERDC Basic Science Curriculum for Upper Basic Education (JSS1)
- State Scheme of Work for Second Term Basic Science
- Approved Basic Science textbooks for Junior Secondary Schools
Instructional Materials:
- Water treatment flow chart
- Sample alum, filter cloth, and transparent container
- Immunization schedule chart
- Whiteboard and marker
Previous Knowledge:
- Learners already know common water-borne diseases and sources of clean water.
Entry Behaviour:
- Learners can mention at least one method used at home to make water safer.
Behavioural Objectives:
By the end of the lesson, learners should be able to:
- explain at least four water treatment processes.
- differentiate filtration from chlorination.
- state at least four advantages of treated pipe-borne water.
- define immunization correctly.
- identify at least four diseases prevented by immunization.
Lesson Presentations:
Step 1: Introduction/Set Induction
- Teacher revises Contact 1 through short oral questions.
- Teacher presents cloudy water and asks how it can be made safe.
Step 2: Presentation/Teaching Steps
- Teacher explains filtration, chlorination, distillation, flocculation, and desalination.
- Teacher discusses advantages of treated pipe-borne water.
- Teacher introduces immunization as protection against specific diseases.
- Teacher gives examples of vaccine-preventable diseases.
Step 3: Learners’ Activities
- Learners observe a simple filtration demonstration.
- Learners complete a table: process and purpose.
- Learners discuss why children should complete immunization schedules.
Step 4: Summary/Board Summary
- Water treatment methods and uses.
- Benefits of treated water.
- Meaning and importance of immunization.
Lesson Content:
Water Treatment Processes
- Filtration: removes visible particles and dirt.
- Chlorination: chlorine kills harmful microorganisms.
- Distillation: evaporates and condenses water to get purer water.
- Flocculation: alum helps tiny particles clump together for removal.
- Desalination: removes salt from sea water.

Advantages of Treated Pipe-borne Water
- Cleaner and safer for drinking.
- Reduced spread of water-borne diseases.
- Convenient domestic supply.
- Better taste and less suspended matter.

Immunization
- Immunization is the process of building body resistance against diseases using vaccines.
- Diseases prevented include polio, measles, tetanus, tuberculosis, and whooping cough.
- Importance: protects child health and reduces disease outbreak.
Evaluation:
1. What is filtration?
2. Differentiate between chlorination and distillation.
3. State two uses of alum in water treatment.
4. Mention four advantages of pipe-borne water.
5. Define immunization.
6. List four diseases that vaccines help prevent.
7. Explain why immunization is important in childhood.
Conclusion:
- Teacher concludes that water treatment and immunization are major tools for disease prevention.
Assignment:
1. Write and explain four water treatment methods.
2. Draw and label a simple home water filtration setup.
3. List five diseases prevented through immunization.
4. State three reasons parents should follow immunization schedules.
